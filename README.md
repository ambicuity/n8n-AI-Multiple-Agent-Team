## üìñ Overview

This project documents the setup of an **AI-powered multi-agent system** built with **n8n** to run and manage a **homelab/business network** like a true **CTO**.

This guide contains all the commands, prompts, and configurations shown in the guide for setting up n8n AI Agents Team, an intelligent AI agent system that can:

- **Monitor** uptime & performance across all your services
- **Troubleshoot** issues automatically using intelligent diagnostics
- **Request approval** before applying fixes (human-in-the-loop)
- **Save time, money, and stress** by leveraging your existing infrastructure
- **Collaborate** through specialized agent roles for complex problems

The system integrates with your already running services such as:
- Uptime Kuma (monitoring)
- Proxmox (virtualization)
- UniFi Controller (network management)
- Plex (media server)
- NAS systems (e.g., ZimaCube)
- And more...

> Inspired by modern AI agent frameworks, but specifically adapted for full **homelab orchestration** and IT operations management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

### Required
- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)
- **Docker** installed on homelab server(s)
- **OpenAI API key** (or other compatible LLM provider)
- **Telegram account** + Bot token (for alerts/approvals)

### Service Access
Access to your existing services:
- **Uptime Kuma** - For monitoring integration
- **UniFi Controller** - Network device management
- **Proxmox** - VM/Container orchestration
- **NAS** (e.g., ZimaCube) - Storage management
- **Plex** - Media server monitoring

### Optional but Recommended
- Secure access via **VPN** or **Twingate**
- SSH access to homelab servers
- Basic understanding of Docker and n8n workflows

---

## ‚ö° Initial Setup

### 1. Demo Website (Testing Agent Monitoring)

Start by creating a simple test website to validate your monitoring setup:

```bash
# Run a simple nginx container
docker run -d --name website -p 8090:80 nginx

# Add custom content
docker exec website sh -c 'echo "<h1>Homelab CTO Agent</h1>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html'
```

**Test the deployment:**
```bash
curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8090
```

You should see the "Homelab CTO Agent" heading.

### 2. n8n Workflow Basics

#### Create Your First Agent Workflow

1. **Add Manual Trigger**
   - Open n8n workflow editor
   - Add a "Manual Trigger" node to start

2. **Add AI Agent Node**
   - Search for "AI Agent" in the node menu
   - Add it to your workflow

3. **Configure the Agent**
   - **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (or compatible)
   - **Memory**: Simple Session Memory
   - **System Prompt**: Define the agent's role (see Agent Evolution section)

4. **Connect HTTP Request Tool**
   - Add HTTP Request node as a tool
   - Configure it to check website status
   - Connect to AI Agent

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Always test with demo containers first!

### Stage 4: Creative Problem Solver
**Capability**: Resolve conflicts (ports, memory, disk)
- Identify resource conflicts
- Suggest port remapping
- Detect memory/disk issues
- Provide optimization recommendations

### Stage 5: Human-in-the-Loop
**Capability**: Always ask before applying fixes
- Present diagnosis and proposed fix
- Request approval via Telegram
- Execute only after confirmation
- Report results to user

**This is the recommended production configuration!**

## üîî Automation Setup

### Scheduled Monitoring

Configure automatic checks at regular intervals:

1. **Add Schedule Trigger**
   - Replace Manual Trigger with Schedule Trigger
   - Set interval: Every 5 minutes (or as needed)

2. **Structured JSON Output**
   - Configure agent to return consistent JSON format
   - Enable easier workflow decisions based on output

**Example JSON Structure**:
```json
{
  "status": "down",
  "service": "website",
  "issue": "Container stopped",
  "proposedFix": "docker restart website",
  "severity": "high"
}
```

3. **Telegram Integration**
   - Add Telegram node for notifications
   - Configure for:
     - Downtime alerts
     - Fix confirmations
     - Approval requests
     - Status reports

**Example Flow**:
```
Agent Detects Issue ‚Üí Propose Fix ‚Üí Send to Telegram ‚Üí Wait for Approval ‚Üí Execute or Skip
```

### God-Mode Prompt (‚ö†Ô∏è Use with Caution!)

Allow autonomous fixes with explicit reporting:

**Example God-Mode System Prompt**:
```
You are an autonomous homelab CTO agent. You can:
1. Diagnose issues across all services
2. Apply fixes automatically

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic monitoring before adding complexity
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test with demo containers before production
3. **Incremental Deployment**: Add one capability at a time
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed notes of each integration

### Security Considerations
1. **Always Require Approval**: For destructive commands (restarts, deletions)
2. **Use Read-Only First**: Start with monitoring before allowing changes
3. **Secure Remote Access**: Use VPN or Twingate for external access
4. **Rotate Credentials**: Regularly update API keys and tokens
5. **Audit Logs**: Keep comprehensive logs of all agent actions

### Performance Optimization
1. **Efficient Polling**: Don't over-poll services (5-minute intervals are usually sufficient)
2. **Caching**: Cache service status to reduce API calls
3. **Conditional Execution**: Only trigger actions when status changes
4. **Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU limits for agent processes

### Reliability Guidelines
1. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Have backup notification channels
2. **Health Checks**: Monitor the monitoring system itself
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue partial operations if some services fail
4. **Recovery Procedures**: Document manual recovery steps

### Team Collaboration
1. **Clear Role Assignment**: Each agent should have well-defined responsibilities
2. **Escalation Paths**: Define when to escalate between agents
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Maintain shared documentation
4. **Version Control**: Track agent prompt and configuration changes
