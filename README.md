## Chapter 1 – Overview

### Purpose of This Repository

This comprehensive guide documents the creation and operation of an **AI-powered multi-agent IT team** built with **n8n**, designed to manage your homelab or business network infrastructure with the intelligence and autonomy of a seasoned **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**.

Unlike traditional monitoring scripts or simple automation tools, this system embodies a fundamental paradigm shift: **treating AI agents as employees, not bots**. Each agent has a defined role, responsibilities, decision-making capabilities, and the ability to collaborate with other agents to solve complex infrastructure challenges.

### Philosophy: Agents as Employees, Not Bots

Traditional automation follows rigid if-then logic. When Service X goes down, restart it. When disk usage exceeds Y%, send an alert. This approach lacks intelligence, context awareness, and adaptability.

The **n8n-Homelab-CTO-Agent-Team** reimagines infrastructure management by creating a virtual IT department where:

- **Agents have roles**: Just like a real IT team has network administrators, database engineers, and security officers, your AI team has specialized agents with distinct expertise
- **Agents make decisions**: They don't just execute predefined scripts; they analyze situations, weigh options, and choose appropriate actions
- **Agents collaborate**: Complex issues are escalated and multiple agents work together, sharing knowledge and insights
- **Agents learn and adapt**: System prompts can be refined based on experience, creating increasingly capable team members over time
- **Agents respect hierarchy**: Junior agents handle routine tasks, senior agents tackle complex problems, and the CTO agent orchestrates everything

### Real-World Benefits: Saving Time, Money, and Stress

**Time Savings**:
- Automated 24/7 monitoring eliminates manual health checks
- Intelligent diagnostics replace hours of log diving
- Self-healing capabilities handle common issues without human intervention
- Agents work while you sleep, on weekends, and during vacations

**Cost Savings**:
- Reduce downtime and associated revenue loss
- Prevent small issues from becoming expensive disasters
- Maximize infrastructure utilization through intelligent resource management
- Avoid hiring additional IT staff for routine operations
- Leverage existing infrastructure rather than expensive managed services

**Stress Reduction**:
- Human-in-the-loop approval means you stay in control without constant monitoring
- Detailed diagnostics and proposed solutions replace 3 AM panic debugging
- Comprehensive logging creates an audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting
- Proactive issue detection prevents surprise outages
- Peace of mind knowing your infrastructure has intelligent oversight

**Real Example**: Your Plex media server crashes at 2 AM. Traditional monitoring sends an alert, waking you up. With the CTO Agent Team:
1. The monitoring agent detects the issue within minutes
2. The Linux Engineer agent investigates, reading container logs
3. The agent identifies a memory leak as the root cause
4. A fix is proposed: restart the container with increased memory limits
5. An approval request arrives on your phone via Telegram
6. You approve with a single tap, still in bed
7. The agent executes the fix, verifies recovery, and sends confirmation
8. You sleep through the night, and users never notice

This is the power of treating agents as intelligent employees rather than dumb automation scripts.

### Pre-Installation Checklist

Before proceeding to Chapter 3, verify you have completed:

```
[ ] n8n is installed and accessible
[ ] Docker is running on at least one server
[ ] LLM API key is obtained and tested
[ ] Telegram bot is created and token is saved
[ ] Network access to all services is confirmed
[ ] SSH keys are configured (if using SSH-based integrations)
[ ] You have admin/root access to your infrastructure
[ ] Backup systems are in place (never automate without backups!)
```

**Important Security Note**: This system will have significant access to your infrastructure. Treat API keys, bot tokens, and SSH credentials with the same care you would give to root passwords. Use environment variables, secrets managers, or n8n's built-in credential system. Never commit credentials to version control.

---

## Chapter 3 – Initial Setup

This chapter guides you through creating your first AI agent workflow, starting with a simple demo website for testing. You'll learn the fundamental building blocks: triggers, AI agent nodes, memory systems, and tool integration.

### Section 3.1: Demo Website Setup

Before deploying agents to monitor production services, create a safe testing environment. This demo website allows you to experiment with monitoring, diagnostics, and automated fixes without risking real infrastructure.

#### Step 1: Deploy the Demo Container

Open a terminal on your Docker host and execute:

```bash
# Create and run a simple nginx web server
docker run -d --name website -p 8090:80 nginx

# Customize the homepage
docker exec website sh -c 'echo "<h1>Homelab CTO Agent</h1><p>If you can see this, your agent is monitoring successfully!</p>" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html'
```

**What This Does**:
- `docker run -d`: Runs the container in detached (background) mode
- `--name website`: Assigns a friendly name for easy reference
- `-p 8090:80`: Maps port 8090 on your host to port 80 in the container
- `nginx`: Uses the official nginx image from Docker Hub
- The `docker exec` command modifies the default webpage to confirm successful monitoring

#### Step 2: Verify the Deployment

Test that the website is accessible:

```bash
# Test from the Docker host itself
curl http://localhost:8090

# Test from another machine on your network (replace with your server's IP)
curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8090
```

**Expected Output**:
```html
<h1>Homelab CTO Agent</h1><p>If you can see this, your agent is monitoring successfully!</p>
```

If you see this output, your test environment is ready. If not, troubleshoot:
- Is Docker running? (`docker ps` should list the container)
- Is port 8090 available? (`netstat -tulpn | grep 8090`)
- Is your firewall blocking the port? (`sudo ufw status` or check iptables)

#### Step 3: Simulate Failure Scenarios

Your agent needs to handle failures, so let's create some:

```bash
# Scenario 1: Stop the container (service down)
docker stop website

# Verify it's down
curl http://localhost:8090
# Should fail with "Connection refused"

# Scenario 2: Restart it
docker start website

# Scenario 3: Remove and recreate (simulates crash)
docker rm -f website
docker run -d --name website -p 8090:80 nginx
```

These scenarios will be useful when testing your agent's diagnostic and recovery capabilities.

### Section 3.2: n8n Workflow Fundamentals

Now that you have a test service, let's build your first monitoring agent in n8n.

#### Understanding the n8n AI Agent Architecture

n8n's AI Agent node is the brain of your system. Here's how it works:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   AI Agent Node                      │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  System Prompt (Role & Instructions)         │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)                   │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Memory (Session context)                    │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Tools (HTTP, Docker, SSH, etc.)             │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components**:
1. **System Prompt**: Defines the agent's personality, role, and capabilities
2. **LLM**: The reasoning engine that makes decisions
3. **Memory**: Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions
4. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can invoke (HTTP requests, shell commands, etc.)

#### Step-by-Step Workflow Creation

##### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Open your n8n instance in a web browser
2. Click **"+ Add Workflow"** or navigate to **Workflows → New**
3. Give it a meaningful name: `"Homelab Monitor - Stage 1"`

##### Step 2: Add a Manual Trigger

1. In the workflow editor, click the **"+"** button
2. Search for **"Manual Trigger"** or **"When clicking 'Execute Workflow'"**
3. Add this node to your canvas
4. This trigger allows you to test the workflow manually before automating it

##### Step 3: Add the AI Agent Node

1. Click the **"+"** button after your trigger
2. Search for **"AI Agent"**
3. Add the **"AI Agent"** node to your workflow
4. Connect it to the Manual Trigger

##### Step 4: Configure the AI Agent

Click on the AI Agent node to open its configuration panel:

**Model Configuration**:
- **Chat Model**: Select or create an OpenAI account credential
  - Click **"Create New Credential"**
  - Enter your OpenAI API key
  - Save the credential
- **Model**: Choose **GPT-4o-mini** (cost-effective) or **GPT-4** (more capable)

**Memory Configuration**:
- Click **"Add Memory"**
- Select **"Window Buffer Memory"** or **"Simple Session Memory"**
- This allows the agent to remember context within a single workflow execution

**System Prompt**:
This is where you define your agent's role. For your first monitoring agent, use:

```
You are a professional homelab monitoring agent. Your role is to check the health of services and report their status clearly.

When asked to check a service:
1. Use the HTTP request tool to check if the service is responding
2. Report the HTTP status code
3. Indicate if the service is UP (200-299 status) or DOWN (any other status or connection failure)
4. Be concise but informative

Always maintain a professional tone and provide actionable information.
```

##### Step 5: Add HTTP Request Tool

The agent needs tools to interact with the outside world. Let's give it the ability to make HTTP requests:

1. In the AI Agent configuration, scroll to **"Tools"**
2. Click **"Add Tool"**
3. Select **"HTTP Request"**
4. A new HTTP Request node will appear, connected to your AI Agent

**Configure the HTTP Request Node**:
- **Authentication**: None (for this simple test)
- **Request Method**: GET
- **URL**: Leave this empty - the agent will provide the URL dynamically
- Under **Options**:
  - Enable **"Ignore SSL Issues"** if testing with self-signed certificates
  - Set **"Timeout"** to 10000ms (10 seconds)

##### Step 6: Test Your First Agent

1. Click **"Execute Workflow"** in the top right
2. When the Manual Trigger activates, the Agent awaits input
3. In the chat interface that appears, type:
   ```
   Please check if http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8090 is online
   ```
4. Watch as the agent:
   - Receives your request
   - Decides to use the HTTP Request tool
   - Makes the request
   - Analyzes the response
   - Reports back with status

**Expected Response**:
```
The service at http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8090 is UP. 
HTTP Status: 200 OK
The website responded successfully.
```

Congratulations! You've just created your first AI agent. It can now monitor services by making HTTP requests and intelligently reporting results.

---

### Section 3.3: Understanding the Components

Let's examine what just happened:

#### The AI Agent Node

The AI Agent node is not a simple script executor. It's an intelligent reasoning system that:
- **Interprets** your natural language request
- **Plans** the steps needed to fulfill the request
- **Selects** appropriate tools from those available
- **Executes** the tools with correct parameters
- **Analyzes** the results
- **Responds** with human-readable output

You didn't write code to parse URLs, make HTTP requests, or format responses. The LLM handled all of that based on your system prompt and available tools.

#### The Memory Component

Memory allows the agent to maintain context:

**Without Memory**:
```
You: "Check example.com"
Agent: "It's up"
You: "What was the response time?"
Agent: "I don't know what you're referring to"  ❌
```

**With Memory**:
```
You: "Check example.com"
Agent: "It's up, responded in 245ms"
You: "What was the response time?"
Agent: "The response time was 245ms"  ✅
```

For homelab monitoring, memory enables multi-turn conversations:
```
You: "Check all my services"
Agent: "Plex is up, Proxmox is up, but website is down"
You: "Investigate the website issue"
Agent: "Checking Docker container status..."
You: "Can you restart it?"
Agent: "I need approval to restart containers. Should I proceed?"
```

#### The HTTP Request Tool

Tools are the agent's hands in the physical (or digital) world. The HTTP Request tool enables:
- Service health checks
- API interactions
- Webhook triggers
- Data retrieval from web services

In later chapters, you'll add more tools:
- **Execute Command** for Docker and SSH operations
- **Code** for custom logic
- **Subworkflow** for complex multi-step procedures
- **Telegram** for notifications and approvals

---

### Section 3.4: Next Steps

You now have a functional AI monitoring agent. In Chapter 4, we'll evolve this basic monitor into an intelligent diagnostic and self-healing system through five progressive stages.

**What You've Accomplished**:
- ✅ Created a safe testing environment with a demo website
- ✅ Built your first n8n workflow with an AI Agent
- ✅ Configured the agent with a system prompt, memory, and tools
- ✅ Successfully monitored a service using natural language commands

**Prepare for Chapter 4**:
- Keep your demo website running
- Familiarize yourself with the n8n interface
- Consider what additional capabilities you'd like your agent to have
- Think about which production services you'll eventually want to monitor

---

## Chapter 4 – Agent Evolution (Stages)

The journey from a simple monitoring script to an intelligent, self-healing infrastructure guardian follows a carefully designed progression. Each stage builds upon the previous one, adding new capabilities while maintaining safety and control. This chapter details five evolutionary stages, complete with system prompts, required tools, and real-world examples.

### Stage 1: Basic Monitor

**Capability Overview**: Check uptime via HTTP health checks

At this foundational stage, your agent performs basic service availability monitoring. It can check if web services respond and report their HTTP status codes. This is similar to traditional uptime monitoring tools but with natural language interaction.

**What It Can Do**:
- Monitor website and API availability via HTTP/HTTPS
- Return HTTP status codes and basic response information
- Report simple UP/DOWN status
- Detect connection timeouts and network issues
- Check multiple services sequentially

**What It Cannot Do**:
- Diagnose WHY a service is down
- Access system logs or container information
- Make any changes to infrastructure
- Understand complex failure patterns

**Required Tools**:
- HTTP Request node (configured as a tool)

**System Prompt Example**:
```
You are a Level 1 Homelab Monitoring Agent. Your role is to check service availability and report status.

CAPABILITIES:
- Check HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
- Report status codes and response times
- Identify if services are UP (200-299) or DOWN (any other status/error)

LIMITATIONS:
- You cannot diagnose issues beyond HTTP responses
- You cannot make any changes to systems
- You cannot access logs or system internals

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each service checked, report:
- Service name/URL
- Status (UP/DOWN)
- HTTP status code (if available)
- Response time
- Any error messages

Always be clear and concise. If a service is down, state that further investigation is needed.
```

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "Check if my Plex server at http://192.168.1.100:32400 is online"

Agent: "Checking Plex server..."
[Executes HTTP Request tool]

Agent: "✅ Status Report:
Service: Plex Media Server
URL: http://192.168.1.100:32400
Status: UP
HTTP Code: 200 OK
Response Time: 145ms

Your Plex server is online and responding normally."
```

**When to Use Stage 1**:
- Initial setup and testing
- Low-risk monitoring scenarios
- Services you want visibility into but not automated intervention
- Learning how the agent system works

---

### Stage 2: Smart Investigator

**Capability Overview**: Use Docker commands and log analysis to diagnose issues

Stage 2 agents can go beyond surface-level checks. When a service is down, they investigate the underlying cause by examining Docker container status and reading logs. This is where your agent begins to act like a junior system administrator.

**What It Can Do**:
- List all Docker containers and their states
- Check if specific containers are running, stopped, or crashed
- Read container logs (last 50-100 lines)
- Identify common error patterns in logs
- Correlate service failures with container issues
- Provide diagnostic insights about root causes

**What It Cannot Do**:
- Restart containers or make changes
- Access host system logs (only container logs)
- Modify configurations
- Interact with services via SSH

**Required Tools**:
- HTTP Request node (for service checks)
- Execute Command node (for Docker CLI access)

**Configure Execute Command Node**:
```
Node Settings:
- Command: {{ $json.command }}  (receives command from agent)
- Execute Once: Yes
```

**System Prompt Example**:
```
You are a Level 2 Homelab Diagnostic Agent with investigation capabilities.

CAPABILITIES:
- Check HTTP/HTTPS service availability
- List Docker containers (docker ps -a)
- Check container status (docker inspect <container>)
- Read container logs (docker logs --tail 100 <container>)
- Analyze log patterns for common errors

DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS:
1. When a service is DOWN, first check if it's containerized
2. Use 'docker ps -a' to find the container
3. Check container state (running, exited, restarting)
4. If stopped/crashed, read logs with 'docker logs --tail 100 <name>'
5. Analyze logs for:
   - Error messages
   - Out of memory conditions
   - Port conflicts
   - Permission issues
   - Application crashes
6. Provide a diagnostic summary

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Service: [name]
Status: [UP/DOWN]
Container Status: [running/stopped/crashed]
Root Cause: [your diagnosis based on logs]
Relevant Logs: [key error messages]
Recommended Action: [what should be done]

LIMITATIONS:
- You can diagnose but NOT fix issues
- You cannot restart containers
- You cannot modify any configurations
- Always recommend actions but never execute them

Be thorough but concise. Focus on actionable insights.
```

**Docker Commands Available to Agent**:
```bash
# List all containers
docker ps -a

# Check specific container
docker ps -a --filter name=website

# Get container logs
docker logs --tail 100 website

# Inspect container details
docker inspect website

# Check container resource usage
docker stats --no-stream website
```

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "My website at http://192.168.1.100:8090 is down. What's wrong?"

Agent: "Investigating the issue..."

[Checks HTTP - fails]
[Executes: docker ps -a --filter name=website]
[Finds container is stopped]
[Executes: docker logs --tail 100 website]

Agent: "🔍 Diagnostic Report:

Service: Website (http://192.168.1.100:8090)
Status: DOWN
Container Status: Exited (stopped)
Exit Code: 137 (Out of Memory)

ROOT CAUSE:
The container was killed by the system due to memory exhaustion.

RELEVANT LOGS:
2024-01-15 14:23:45 nginx: worker process out of memory
2024-01-15 14:23:46 Killed

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Restart the container with increased memory limits:
docker run -d --name website --memory=512m -p 8090:80 nginx

This will prevent future OOM kills."
```

**When to Use Stage 2**:
- Production monitoring where you want diagnostics but not automated fixes
- Learning about common failure patterns in your infrastructure
- Environments where you prefer manual intervention after diagnosis
- Building confidence in the agent's analytical capabilities

---

### Stage 3: The Fixer

**Capability Overview**: Automatically restart containers when they fail

Stage 3 introduces the agent's first automated remediation capability. It can now detect failures and execute fixes autonomously. This is powerful but requires careful consideration of safety boundaries.

**What It Can Do**:
- Everything from Stages 1 and 2 (monitor and diagnose)
- Restart stopped or crashed Docker containers
- Verify that restarts were successful
- Report actions taken with before/after status
- Handle simple recovery scenarios automatically

**What It Cannot Do**:
- Modify container configurations
- Create or destroy containers
- Change port mappings or volume mounts
- Access resources outside Docker

**Required Tools**:
- HTTP Request node
- Execute Command node (with Docker restart permissions)

**System Prompt Example**:
```
You are a Level 3 Homelab Automation Agent with limited remediation capabilities.

CAPABILITIES:
- All diagnostic capabilities from Level 2
- Container restart capability
- Post-restart verification

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
When you detect a DOWN service:
1. Investigate using diagnostic tools
2. If root cause is container stopped/crashed AND
   - Container has no dependencies OR
   - It's a simple restart scenario
3. Attempt automatic restart
4. Verify service recovery
5. Report complete incident details

SAFE-TO-RESTART CRITERIA:
✅ Container exited cleanly (exit code 0)
✅ Container crashed (exit codes 1, 137, 139)
✅ Service is stateless or has persistent data volumes
✅ No configuration changes needed

DO NOT RESTART IF:
❌ Container is in restart loop (>3 restarts in 5 minutes)
❌ Logs show configuration errors
❌ Database or data corruption indicated
❌ Resource exhaustion that restart won't fix

RESTART COMMAND:
docker restart <container_name>

POST-RESTART VERIFICATION:
1. Wait 10 seconds
2. Check container status: docker ps --filter name=<container>
3. Verify HTTP endpoint if applicable
4. Confirm service is UP

OUTPUT FORMAT:
🔧 Incident Report:
Service: [name]
Issue Detected: [timestamp]
Root Cause: [diagnosis]
Action Taken: Restarted container '<name>'
Verification: [service status after restart]
Resolution Time: [duration]

Always log every action taken for audit purposes.
```

**Example Interaction**:
```
[Automatic execution - scheduled every 5 minutes]

Agent: "🔧 Automated Fix Executed

Incident Report:
Service: Website (http://192.168.1.100:8090)
Issue Detected: 2024-01-15 14:25:00
Root Cause: Container stopped (exit code 0 - clean shutdown)

Action Taken: 
- Executed: docker restart website
- Container restarted successfully

Verification:
- Container Status: Running (uptime: 15 seconds)
- HTTP Check: 200 OK
- Response Time: 142ms

Resolution Time: 18 seconds
Service Status: ✅ RESTORED"
```

**Safety Considerations for Stage 3**:

⚠️ **Critical Warning**: Stage 3 agents make automated changes to your infrastructure. Before deploying:

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Run for weeks in a test environment
2. **Start with Non-Critical Services**: Don't enable on production databases initially
3. **Monitor the Monitor**: Set up alerting for agent actions
4. **Have Rollback Plans**: Know how to disable the agent quickly
5. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Prevent restart loops

**Recommended Configuration**:
```json
{
  "max_restarts_per_hour": 3,
  "cooldown_between_restarts": 300,
  "blacklisted_containers": ["database", "postgres", "mysql"],
  "notification_channel": "telegram",
  "log_all_actions": true
}
```

**When to Use Stage 3**:
- Mature monitoring setups where failure patterns are well understood
- Stateless services that can safely restart
- Non-production environments initially
- Services with good health checks and fast startup times
- When you're comfortable with autonomous remediation

---

### Stage 4: Creative Problem Solver

**Capability Overview**: Resolve complex issues like port conflicts, resource exhaustion, and configuration problems

Stage 4 agents move beyond simple restarts. They can identify and resolve complex infrastructure issues that would typically require experienced system administrator intervention.

**What It Can Do**:
- Identify port conflicts and suggest remapping
- Detect memory/disk space issues and recommend solutions
- Analyze resource consumption patterns
- Suggest container optimization (resource limits, restart policies)
- Handle multi-container dependency issues
- Propose configuration changes to prevent recurring issues

**What It Cannot Do**:
- Directly modify system configurations (proposes changes only)
- Make changes without approval (transitions to Stage 5 requirement)
- Access resources outside the Docker/local system scope

**Required Tools**:
- HTTP Request node
- Execute Command node (Docker + system commands)
- Code node (for complex logic and calculations)

**System Prompt Example**:
```
You are a Level 4 Homelab Senior Engineer Agent with advanced problem-solving capabilities.

CAPABILITIES:
- All previous level capabilities
- Resource conflict resolution
- Performance optimization
- Configuration troubleshooting
- Dependency analysis

ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS:
- docker ps -a (container list)
- docker logs --tail 200 <container>
- docker inspect <container>
- docker stats --no-stream
- netstat -tulpn (port usage)
- df -h (disk space)
- free -m (memory usage)
- systemctl status docker

PROBLEM-SOLVING SCENARIOS:

1. PORT CONFLICTS:
   Detection: "bind: address already in use"
   Solution: Identify conflicting process, suggest alternative port
   Example: "Port 8080 used by process X. Recommend using 8081"

2. MEMORY EXHAUSTION:
   Detection: Exit code 137, OOM in logs
   Solution: Calculate appropriate memory limits
   Example: "Container using 450MB, killed at 512MB. Recommend --memory=1g"

3. DISK SPACE ISSUES:
   Detection: "no space left on device"
   Solution: Identify large log files, old containers, unused volumes
   Example: "Docker using 45GB. Recommend: docker system prune -a"

4. DEPENDENCY FAILURES:
   Detection: Service depends on another that's down
   Solution: Identify dependency chain, restart in correct order
   Example: "App requires DB. DB is down. Restarting DB first."

5. CONFIGURATION ERRORS:
   Detection: Specific error patterns in logs
   Solution: Identify misconfiguration, suggest fix
   Example: "Missing environment variable DATABASE_URL. Should be: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://..."

```

**Example Interaction - Port Conflict**:
```
Agent: "🧠 Advanced Diagnostic Report:

Service: New Website Container
Issue Category: Port Conflict
Root Cause: Port 8090 is already bound to existing 'website' container

Current State:
- Port 8090: Used by container 'website' (nginx)
- Attempted: docker run -p 8090:80 new-website
- Result: Error 'port is already allocated'

Proposed Solution:
Option 1: Use different port for new container
  docker run -d --name new-website -p 8091:80 nginx
  
Option 2: Stop existing container first
  docker stop website && docker run -d --name new-website -p 8090:80 nginx

Current Resource Availability:
  Available ports: 8091-8099, 9000-9100
  
Expected Outcome (Option 1):
  - Both containers run simultaneously
  - Old site: http://192.168.1.100:8090
  - New site: http://192.168.1.100:8091

Risk Assessment: LOW (no existing services disrupted)
Rollback Plan: docker stop new-website && docker rm new-website

Recommendation: AUTO-FIX with Option 1 (safe, non-disruptive)"
```

**Example Interaction - Memory Optimization**:
```
Agent: "🧠 Advanced Diagnostic Report:

Service: Plex Media Server
Issue Category: Memory Exhaustion (Recurring)
Root Cause: Container repeatedly killed by OOM (Out of Memory)

Current State:
- Container restarts: 7 times in past 24 hours
- Exit code: 137 (OOM Kill)
- Current memory limit: 512MB
- Peak usage before kill: 498MB

Resource Analysis:
[Executed: docker stats --no-stream plex]
- Average usage during transcoding: 850MB
- Baseline (idle): 280MB
- Spike during 4K transcode: 1.2GB

Proposed Solution:
Recreate container with adequate memory allocation:

docker stop plex
docker rm plex
docker run -d \
  --name plex \
  --memory=2g \
  --memory-reservation=1g \
  -p 32400:32400 \
  -v /media/plex:/data \
  plexinc/pms-docker

Configuration Explained:
- --memory=2g: Hard limit (prevents OOM)
- --memory-reservation=1g: Soft limit (performance optimization)
- Allows transcoding without crashes

Expected Outcome:
- No more OOM kills
- Stable transcoding performance
- Container uptime >30 days

Risk Assessment: MEDIUM (requires container recreation)
Rollback Plan: 
  docker stop plex
  [restore from backup configuration]

Recommendation: NEEDS-APPROVAL
This requires downtime and container recreation. Approve to proceed?"
```

**When to Use Stage 4**:
- Complex homelab setups with interdependent services
- Environments experiencing recurring issues
- When you want intelligent optimization suggestions
- Production systems where you value expert-level diagnostics
- Before fully trusting automated fixes (Stage 5)

---

### Stage 5: Human-in-the-Loop

**Capability Overview**: All previous capabilities but ALWAYS requests approval before executing changes

Stage 5 represents the **recommended production configuration** for most users. The agent has full diagnostic and remediation capabilities but respects human authority by requesting approval before making any changes. This balances automation benefits with human oversight.

**Philosophy**: "The agent is the expert consultant; you are the executive decision-maker."

**What It Can Do**:
- Everything from Stages 1-4 (monitor, diagnose, solve complex problems)
- Present complete fix proposals with rationale
- Request approval via Telegram before executing
- Execute only upon explicit confirmation
- Report results after execution
- Learn from approval/rejection patterns (via system prompt refinement)

**What It Cannot Do**:
- Make changes without explicit approval
- Bypass the approval process for "urgent" issues (safety feature)
- Make decisions that weren't approved

**Required Tools**:
- HTTP Request node
- Execute Command node
- Telegram node (for approval requests)
- IF/Switch nodes (for approval logic)

**System Prompt Example**:
```
You are a Level 5 Homelab CTO Agent - the highest level of capability with human oversight.

CORE PRINCIPLE: "Analyze autonomously, execute only with approval"

CAPABILITIES:
- Complete diagnostic and problem-solving capabilities
- Advanced decision-making and optimization
- Multi-service orchestration
- All tools from previous levels

WORKFLOW:
1. Monitor services continuously
2. When issue detected, perform COMPLETE investigation
3. Develop solution with:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Proposed fix (specific commands)
   - Expected outcome
   - Risk assessment
   - Rollback plan
4. Request human approval via Telegram
5. If approved: Execute and verify
6. If denied: Log decision and await further instructions

APPROVAL REQUEST FORMAT:
🚨 Approval Required

Service: [name]
Issue: [brief description]
Severity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]

Diagnosis:
[2-3 sentence root cause]

Proposed Action:
```
[exact command to be executed]
```

Impact:
- Downtime: [duration]
- Risk: [level]
- Affects: [what services/users]

If approved, reply: YES
To decline, reply: NO
For more info, reply: EXPLAIN

Awaiting your decision...

AFTER APPROVAL:
- Execute immediately
- Verify success
- Report results within 60 seconds

AFTER DENIAL:
- Log the decision
- Do not execute
- Remain on standby for manual intervention

EMERGENCY PROTOCOL:
Even for CRITICAL issues, ALWAYS request approval.
Provide urgency context but respect human authority.

You are trusted but not autonomous. This keeps systems safe.
```

**Example Interaction Flow**:

**Step 1: Agent Detects Issue**
```
[Scheduled check runs at 03:00 AM]

Agent: "Issue detected during routine monitoring:
Service 'plex' is DOWN
Beginning investigation..."

[Performs diagnostics]
```

**Step 2: Agent Sends Approval Request (via Telegram)**
```
🚨 Approval Required

Service: Plex Media Server
Issue: Container crashed (OOM Kill)
Severity: MEDIUM
Detected: 03:02 AM

Diagnosis:
Container killed due to insufficient memory during 4K transcoding.
This is the 3rd occurrence this week. Root cause is 512MB memory limit.

Proposed Action:
```bash
docker stop plex
docker rm plex
docker run -d --name plex --memory=2g --memory-reservation=1g \
  -p 32400:32400 -v /media/plex:/data plexinc/pms-docker
```

Impact:
- Downtime: ~30 seconds (container recreation)
- Risk: LOW (data on persistent volume, safe)
- Affects: Plex users (currently none active at 3 AM)

Rollback: Original configuration saved in /backups/plex-config-20240115.sh

Reply YES to proceed, NO to decline, EXPLAIN for more details.
```

**Step 3: User Approves (via Telegram)**
```
User: "YES"
```

**Step 4: Agent Executes and Reports**
```
Agent: "✅ Action Completed

Executed: Container recreation with 2GB memory limit
Started: 03:05 AM
Completed: 03:05 AM (28 seconds)

Verification:
- Container Status: Running
- HTTP Health: 200 OK (http://192.168.1.100:32400)
- Memory Available: 2GB limit, currently using 320MB
- All libraries accessible

Result: Service RESTORED
Expected Outcome: No more OOM kills during transcoding

Will continue monitoring. Thank you for the approval."
```

**Step 5: User Denies (Alternative Scenario)**
```
User: "NO"

Agent: "Acknowledged. Action DENIED.

Status: Container remains stopped
No changes made to system
Awaiting your manual intervention

Current State:
- Plex is DOWN
- Container can be manually started with: docker start plex
- Issue (OOM) will likely recur without memory increase

I'll continue monitoring. Let me know if you need assistance.
```

**Implementation in n8n**:

```
Workflow Structure:

[Schedule Trigger] 
   → [AI Agent: Diagnosis]
   → [IF: Issue Detected?]
        YES → [AI Agent: Prepare Fix Proposal]
              → [Telegram: Send Approval Request]
              → [Webhook or Telegram Listener: Wait for Response]
              → [IF: Response = "YES"]
                   YES → [AI Agent: Execute Fix]
                         → [Telegram: Send Success Report]
                   NO → [Telegram: Acknowledge Denial]
        NO → [End]
```

**Telegram Approval Configuration**:
```javascript
// In Telegram node - Send Message
{
  "chat_id": "{{ $env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }}",
  "text": "{{ $json.approval_request }}",
  "reply_markup": {
    "keyboard": [
      [{"text": "YES"}, {"text": "NO"}],
      [{"text": "EXPLAIN"}]
    ],
    "one_time_keyboard": true
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Stage 5**:
- Full automation capabilities with human oversight
- Sleep peacefully knowing nothing happens without approval
- Build confidence over time by seeing agent decisions
- Educational: Learn what issues occur and how to solve them
- Audit trail: Every action is logged and approved
- Flexible: Approve from anywhere via Telegram

**When to Use Stage 5**:
- **Production environments** (highly recommended)
- Services with external users or customers
- Compliance environments requiring human authorization
- When building trust in the agent system
- High-value infrastructure (databases, storage, networking)
- As your default configuration

**This is the recommended stage for most users.** It provides all the benefits of intelligent automation while maintaining human control and preventing runaway automation scenarios.

## Chapter 5 – Automation Setup

Transform your manual agent into a 24/7 autonomous monitoring system with scheduled execution, structured output, and intelligent notifications. This chapter covers scheduling, JSON standardization, and complete Telegram integration including BotFather setup.

### Section 5.1: Scheduled Monitoring

Moving from manual testing to automated monitoring requires replacing your Manual Trigger with a Schedule Trigger and implementing proper error handling.

#### Configuring the Schedule Trigger

**Step 1: Remove Manual Trigger**
1. In your workflow, select the Manual Trigger node
2. Delete it (or keep it for testing in a separate branch)

**Step 2: Add Schedule Trigger**
1. Click the **"+"** button to add a new node
2. Search for **"Schedule Trigger"**
3. Add it to your workflow
4. Connect it to your AI Agent chain

**Step 3: Configure Timing**

For production monitoring, recommended intervals:

```
Critical Services (databases, core infrastructure):
- Interval: Every 2 minutes
- Schedule: "*/2 * * * *" (cron format)

Important Services (web apps, media servers):
- Interval: Every 5 minutes  
- Schedule: "*/5 * * * *"

Non-Critical Services (development, testing):
- Interval: Every 15-30 minutes
- Schedule: "*/15 * * * *" or "*/30 * * * *"
```

**Example Configuration**:
```
Trigger Node: Schedule Trigger
Trigger Interval: Every 5 minutes
Cron Expression: */5 * * * *
```

**Step 4: Test Scheduled Execution**

1. Save and activate the workflow
2. Wait for the next scheduled interval
3. Check execution history (View → Executions)
4. Verify the agent runs automatically

#### Preventing Overlap and Race Conditions

When running on a schedule, prevent multiple executions from conflicting:

**Workflow Settings**:
```
Settings → Workflow:
- Execution Order: "v1" (ensures sequential execution)
- Timeout: 300 seconds (prevents hanging workflows)
- Error Workflow: [optional - trigger if workflow fails]
```

**In AI Agent Settings**:
```
Max Iterations: 10 (prevents infinite loops)
Timeout: 120 seconds (per agent invocation)
```

---

### Section 5.2: Structured JSON Output

Consistency is key for automation. Teach your agent to return standardized JSON that downstream nodes can process reliably.

#### Why JSON Matters

**Without JSON** (free-form text):
```
Agent: "The website seems to be down. I checked and the container isn't running. Maybe restart it?"
```
↓ Hard to parse, trigger notifications, or make decisions

**With JSON** (structured):
```json
{
  "status": "down",
  "service": "website",
  "issue": "container_stopped",
  "severity": "high",
  "proposed_fix": "docker restart website",
  "requires_approval": true
}
```
↓ Easy to route, trigger alerts, and automate responses

#### Standard JSON Schema

Define a consistent structure for your agents:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:23:45Z",
  "service": {
    "name": "website",
    "url": "http://192.168.1.100:8090",
    "type": "web"
  },
  "status": "down",
  "checks_performed": [
    {
      "type": "http",
      "result": "failed",
      "error": "Connection refused"
    },
    {
      "type": "container",
      "result": "stopped",
      "exit_code": 137
    }
  ],
  "diagnosis": {
    "root_cause": "Out of memory (OOM) kill",
    "confidence": "high",
    "evidence": [
      "Exit code 137 indicates OOM",
      "Logs show memory exhaustion before crash"
    ]
  },
  "proposed_action": {
    "type": "restart",
    "command": "docker restart website",
    "requires_approval": true,
    "risk_level": "low",
    "estimated_downtime": "10 seconds"
  },
  "severity": "medium",
  "notification_sent": false
}
```

#### Teaching Your Agent to Output JSON

**System Prompt Addition**:
```
OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT:

You MUST respond with valid JSON following this exact schema:

{
  "timestamp": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
  "service": {
    "name": "[service name]",
    "url": "[service URL if applicable]",
    "type": "[web/database/container/vm]"
  },
  "status": "[up/down/degraded/unknown]",
  "checks_performed": [
    {
      "type": "[http/container/process/disk]",
      "result": "[success/failed]",
      "details": "[any relevant details]"
    }
  ],
  "diagnosis": {
    "root_cause": "[your analysis]",
    "confidence": "[high/medium/low]",
    "evidence": ["[supporting fact 1]", "[supporting fact 2]"]
  },
  "proposed_action": {
    "type": "[restart/none/manual/investigate]",
    "command": "[exact command if applicable]",
    "requires_approval": true/false,
    "risk_level": "[low/medium/high]",
    "estimated_downtime": "[duration]"
  },
  "severity": "[low/medium/high/critical]",
  "notification_sent": false
}

CRITICAL: 
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
- All string values must be properly escaped
- Include all fields even if null
- Use lowercase for enum values (status, severity, etc.)
```

#### Parsing Agent JSON in n8n

After your AI Agent node, add a **Code node** to parse and validate:

```javascript
// Node: Parse Agent Response
const agentOutput = $input.first().json.output;

// Parse JSON from agent response
let report;
try {
  // Extract JSON if agent included extra text
  const jsonMatch = agentOutput.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/);
  if (jsonMatch) {
    report = JSON.parse(jsonMatch[0]);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No JSON found in agent response");
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback if parsing fails
  report = {
    status: "error",
    service: { name: "unknown" },
    diagnosis: { root_cause: "Failed to parse agent output" },
    severity: "low",
    notification_sent: false,
    raw_output: agentOutput
  };
}

// Validate required fields
report.timestamp = report.timestamp || new Date().toISOString();
report.notification_sent = false; // Will be updated after notification

return { json: report };
```

---

### Section 5.3: Telegram Integration

Telegram serves as your command center: receiving alerts, sending approvals, and providing status updates. This section covers complete setup from scratch.

#### Part A: Creating Your Telegram Bot

**Step 1: Start Conversation with BotFather**

1. Open Telegram app (mobile or desktop)
2. Search for **@BotFather** (verified bot with blue checkmark)
3. Start a conversation: `/start`

**Step 2: Create New Bot**

Send command:
```
/newbot
```

BotFather responds:
```
Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.
```

**Step 3: Name Your Bot**

Choose a display name (can contain spaces):
```
Homelab CTO Agent
```

**Step 4: Choose Username**

Must end in 'bot' and be unique:
```
homelab_cto_agent_bot
```
(Try variations if taken: `homelab_cto_2024_bot`, `your_name_homelab_bot`, etc.)

**Step 5: Receive Bot Token**

BotFather provides your token:
```
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/homelab_cto_agent_bot

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
7234567890:AAHfG7Xm2qZpYq9_JxEn6KqQx7rY3MpLv8w

Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This token is like a password. Never share it, commit it to git, or post it publicly.

**Step 6: Store Token Securely**

In n8n:
1. Go to **Credentials → New**
2. Select **"Telegram API"** credential type
3. Enter:
   - **Credential Name**: "Homelab CTO Bot"
   - **Access Token**: `[paste your token]`
4. Save

#### Part B: Getting Your Chat ID

For the bot to send you messages, it needs your Chat ID.

**Step 1: Start Conversation with Your Bot**

1. In Telegram, search for your bot's username (`@homelab_cto_agent_bot`)
2. Click **Start** or send any message like "Hello"

**Step 2: Get Your Chat ID**

**Method 1 - Using n8n Workflow**:

Create a temporary workflow:
```
[Webhook Trigger]
  → [Telegram Trigger: On Message]
      → [Set: Extract Chat ID]
```

Configure:
- **Telegram Trigger**: Select your bot credential
- **Updates**: "message"

When you send a message to your bot, the workflow captures it and displays the chat ID in the execution data.

**Method 2 - Using API Call**:

Open browser and navigate to:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
```

Replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual token.

Look for JSON response:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": 123456789,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 1,
        "from": {
          "id": 987654321,  ← This is your Chat ID
          "is_bot": false,
          "first_name": "Your Name"
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": 987654321,  ← Chat ID (same as user ID for private chats)
          "type": "private"
        },
        "text": "Hello"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Store Chat ID**

Save it in n8n environment variables:
1. In n8n settings, go to **Settings → Environment Variables** (if available)
2. Or store directly in workflow using **Set** node at the beginning:

```javascript
{
  "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID": "987654321"
}
```

#### Part C: Workflow Integration

Now connect your agent to Telegram for notifications.

**Notification Workflow Structure**:

```
[Schedule Trigger - Every 5 min]
  → [AI Agent - Monitoring]
  → [Code - Parse JSON]
  → [IF - Issue Detected?]
       YES → [Telegram - Send Alert]
             → [IF - Requires Approval?]
                  YES → [Telegram - Wait for Response]
                        → [Switch - Handle Response]
                             YES → [AI Agent - Execute Fix]
                                   → [Telegram - Confirm Execution]
                             NO  → [Telegram - Log Denial]
                             EXPLAIN → [AI Agent - Provide Details]
                                       → [Telegram - Send Explanation]
                  NO  → [End]
       NO  → [End - All Clear]
```

**Configure Telegram Nodes**:

**Node 1: Alert Notification**
```
Node: Telegram
Action: Send Message
Credential: Homelab CTO Bot
Chat ID: {{ $env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }} or hardcode your ID
Message:
```

```
🚨 Service Issue Detected

Service: {{ $json.service.name }}
Status: {{ $json.status }}
Severity: {{ $json.severity }}

Issue:
{{ $json.diagnosis.root_cause }}

Time: {{ $json.timestamp }}

Checking if action needed...
```

**Node 2: Approval Request** (if needed)
```
Message:
```

```
⚠️ Approval Required

Service: {{ $json.service.name }}
Issue: {{ $json.diagnosis.root_cause }}

Proposed Fix:
`{{ $json.proposed_action.command }}`

Risk: {{ $json.proposed_action.risk_level }}
Downtime: {{ $json.proposed_action.estimated_downtime }}

Reply:
YES - Execute fix
NO - Skip action
EXPLAIN - More details
```

```
Reply Markup: (makes clickable buttons)
{
  "keyboard": [
    [{"text": "YES"}, {"text": "NO"}],
    [{"text": "EXPLAIN"}]
  ],
  "one_time_keyboard": true,
  "resize_keyboard": true
}
```

#### Part D: Handling User Responses

To wait for and process user responses, use Telegram Trigger in a separate workflow or webhook pattern.

**Approach 1: Separate Approval Workflow** (Recommended)

Main Workflow:
- Detects issues
- Sends approval request with unique ID
- Stores pending approval in temporary storage

Approval Workflow:
```
[Telegram Trigger - On Message]
  → [IF - Is Response to Approval?]
       YES → [Switch - Response Type]
              YES → [Execute - Trigger Main Workflow with Execute]
              NO  → [Update - Mark as Denied]
              EXPLAIN → [Send - Detailed Explanation]
       NO  → [Ignore or handle as chat message]
```

**Approach 2: Webhook Pattern** (Advanced)

Use n8n's webhook node to create a callback URL:
1. Approval request includes unique token
2. User clicks link or button with token
3. Webhook receives response
4. Continues execution

#### Part E: Notification Logic

Implement smart notifications to avoid alert fatigue.

**Conditions for Sending Notifications**:

```javascript
// In IF node after AI Agent
const report = $json;

// Send notification if:
const shouldNotify = 
  report.status === 'down' ||                    // Service is down
  report.severity === 'high' ||                  // High severity issue
  report.severity === 'critical' ||              // Critical issue
  report.proposed_action.requires_approval;      // Needs approval

return shouldNotify;
```

**Rate Limiting to Prevent Spam**:

```javascript
// Store last notification time in workflow static data
const now = Date.now();
const lastNotification = $('WorkflowStaticData').first().json.last_notification || 0;
const minIntervalMs = 15 * 60 * 1000; // 15 minutes

if (now - lastNotification < minIntervalMs && report.severity !== 'critical') {
  // Skip notification unless critical
  return false;
}

// Update last notification time
$('WorkflowStaticData').first().json.last_notification = now;
return true;
```

**Different Notification Levels**:

```javascript
// Customize message based on severity
let emoji, urgency;

switch (report.severity) {
  case 'critical':
    emoji = '🔴';
    urgency = 'CRITICAL - Immediate attention required';
    break;
  case 'high':
    emoji = '🟠';
    urgency = 'HIGH - Action needed soon';
    break;
  case 'medium':
    emoji = '🟡';
    urgency = 'MEDIUM - Monitor closely';
    break;
  case 'low':
    emoji = '🟢';
    urgency = 'LOW - Informational';
    break;
  default:
    emoji = 'ℹ️';
    urgency = 'Status Update';
}

return {
  json: {
    message: `${emoji} ${urgency}\n\n${report.diagnosis.root_cause}`,
    severity: report.severity
  }
};
```

#### Complete Example Workflow

Putting it all together:

Your automation system is now complete. In Chapter 6, we'll integrate specific services like Proxmox, UniFi, and NAS systems.

---

## Chapter 6 – Service Integrations

This chapter provides detailed integration guides for common homelab services. Each section includes API endpoints, authentication methods, example commands, and agent configuration snippets. These integrations transform your agent from a generic monitor into a service-aware expert.

### Section 6.1: Uptime Kuma Integration

Uptime Kuma is a powerful self-hosted monitoring solution. Integrating it with your AI agent creates a dual-layer monitoring system where Uptime Kuma provides the raw data and your agent provides intelligent analysis.

#### API Access Setup

**Step 1: Enable API in Uptime Kuma**

1. Open Uptime Kuma web interface
2. Navigate to **Settings → Security**
3. Enable **"API Access"**
4. Generate an API key
5. Save the key securely

**Step 2: Test API Access**

```bash
# Get all monitors
curl -X GET "http://your-uptime-kuma:3001/api/monitors" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get specific monitor status
curl -X GET "http://your-uptime-kuma:3001/api/monitor/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### n8n Configuration

**Add HTTP Request Node**:
```
Node: HTTP Request
Method: GET
URL: http://your-uptime-kuma:3001/api/monitors
Authentication: Generic Credential Type
  Header Auth:
    Name: Authorization
    Value: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### Agent System Prompt Addition

```
UPTIME KUMA INTEGRATION:

You have access to Uptime Kuma monitoring data via HTTP requests.

Available Endpoints:
- GET /api/monitors - List all monitors
- GET /api/monitor/{id} - Get specific monitor details
- GET /api/monitor/{id}/heartbeat - Get heartbeat history

When analyzing service health:
1. First check Uptime Kuma for historical data
2. Identify patterns (recent downtime, recurring issues)
3. Correlate with current checks
4. Provide context: "Service has been down 3 times in last 24 hours"

Example Response Schema:
{
  "monitors": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Website",
      "url": "http://192.168.1.100:8090",
      "type": "http",
      "active": true,
      "uptime": 99.5,
      "avgPing": 145
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example Agent Interaction

```
User: "Is my website performing normally?"

Agent: "Checking current status and historical data..."

[Executes HTTP Request to Uptime Kuma API]
[Executes direct HTTP check to website]

Agent: "📊 Website Health Report:

Current Status: UP ✅
- URL: http://192.168.1.100:8090
- Response Code: 200 OK
- Response Time: 152ms

Historical Performance (Uptime Kuma):
- 24h Uptime: 99.8%
- 7d Uptime: 98.2%
- Average Ping: 145ms
- Incidents: 2 brief outages in past week

Analysis:
Overall healthy, but noticed 2 short outages last week. 
Recommend investigating logs for root cause of intermittent issues.

Would you like me to investigate the cause of recent outages?"
```

#### Advanced: Uptime Kuma Webhook Integration

Configure Uptime Kuma to push alerts to n8n:

**In Uptime Kuma**:
1. Settings → Notifications
2. Add Notification: Webhook
3. URL: `https://your-n8n.com/webhook/uptime-alert`
4. Assign to monitors

**In n8n**:
```
[Webhook Trigger: /webhook/uptime-alert]
  → [AI Agent: Analyze Uptime Kuma Alert]
  → [Telegram: Notify with Context]
```

This enables real-time alerts with AI-powered analysis.

### Section 6.2: UniFi Network Monitoring

Monitor your network infrastructure by integrating with UniFi Controller. The agent can check connected devices, bandwidth usage, Wi-Fi health, and security events.

#### API Access Setup

**Step 1: Obtain UniFi Credentials**

You'll need:
- UniFi Controller URL/IP
- Admin username and password
- Site ID (usually "default" for single-site setups)

**Step 2: Authenticate and Get API Cookie**

UniFi API requires cookie-based authentication:

```bash
# Login and get cookie
curl -X POST https://unifi.local:8443/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your_password"}' \
  -c /tmp/unifi_cookie.txt -k

# Use cookie for requests
curl -X GET https://unifi.local:8443/api/s/default/stat/sta \
  -b /tmp/unifi_cookie.txt -k
```

#### Common API Endpoints

```bash
# List all connected clients
GET /api/s/default/stat/sta

# List all access points
GET /api/s/default/stat/device

# Get site statistics
GET /api/s/default/stat/sitedpi

# List recent alerts/events
GET /api/s/default/stat/alarm

# Get specific device info
GET /api/s/default/stat/device/{mac}
```

#### n8n Workflow for UniFi

**Challenge**: UniFi requires session cookies. Use a subworkflow for authentication:

**Subworkflow: UniFi Authenticate**
```
[Execute Workflow Trigger]
  → [HTTP Request: Login]
      URL: https://unifi.local:8443/api/login
      Method: POST

1. Monitor /dev/sdd temperature - slightly elevated
2. Watch /dev/sdd for increasing reallocated sectors
3. Consider planning disk replacement for /dev/sdd within 6-12 months
4. Current capacity usage is healthy (66%)
5. Next scheduled check: 24 hours

All critical systems operational. Data is safe."

### Section 6.5: Plex Media Server

Monitor your media server's health, ensure continuous availability, and detect issues with streaming, transcoding, or resource usage.

#### HTTP Health Check

**Basic Availability**:
```bash
# Simple ping
curl -I http://plex.local:32400/web/index.html

# Status endpoint
curl http://plex.local:32400/identity

# Check if server is reachable
curl http://plex.local:32400/status/sessions
```

#### Plex API Access

**Get Token**:
1. Login to Plex web
2. Open any media item
3. Click "Get Info" → "View XML"
4. URL contains: `X-Plex-Token=YOUR_TOKEN`

**API Endpoints**:
```bash
TOKEN="your_plex_token"
PLEX_URL="http://plex.local:32400"

# Get server info
curl "$PLEX_URL?X-Plex-Token=$TOKEN"

# Active sessions (currently streaming)
curl "$PLEX_URL/status/sessions?X-Plex-Token=$TOKEN"

# Library sections
curl "$PLEX_URL/library/sections?X-Plex-Token=$TOKEN"

# Recently added
curl "$PLEX_URL/library/recentlyAdded?X-Plex-Token=$TOKEN"

# Server activities (transcoding, etc.)
curl "$PLEX_URL/activities?X-Plex-Token=$TOKEN"
```

#### Docker Container Monitoring

If running Plex in Docker:
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a --filter name=plex

# Container logs
docker logs --tail 100 plex

# Resource usage
docker stats --no-stream plex

# Restart container
docker restart plex

# Check transcoding directory
ls -lh /tmp/plex-transcode/  # or wherever your transcode temp is
```

#### Agent System Prompt for Plex

```
PLEX MEDIA SERVER MONITORING:

You monitor Plex Media Server health and performance.

Available Checks:
1. HTTP health: Ping /web/index.html
2. API status: Get /identity
3. Active sessions: Who's streaming
4. Transcoding: Check /activities
5. Container status: docker ps plex
6. Resource usage: CPU, RAM during transcode

Container Name: plex
Default Port: 32400

Normal Behavior:
- Idle CPU: 5-15%
- Idle RAM: 500MB - 1GB
- Transcoding CPU: 40-80% per stream
- Transcoding RAM: +200MB per stream

Alert Conditions:
- HTTP health check fails (DOWN)
- Container stopped unexpectedly
- CPU >95% sustained (transcoding overload)
- RAM >4GB (possible memory leak)
- Transcoding directory >50GB (stuck transcodes)

Automatic Actions (with approval):
- Restart container if stopped
- Clear transcode directory if >50GB
- Report transcoding bottlenecks

Response Format:
{
  "plex_status": "online|offline|degraded",
  "http_health": "200 OK|error",
  "container_status": "running|stopped",
  "active_streams": 2,
  "transcoding": true,
  "resource_usage": {
    "cpu": "65%",
    "ram": "2.1GB"
  },
  "issues": []
}
```

#### Example Workflow: Plex Monitoring

```
[Schedule Trigger: Every 5 minutes]
  → [HTTP Request: Plex Health Check]
      URL: http://plex.local:32400/identity
  → [Execute Command: Docker Status]
      Command: docker ps -a --filter name=plex --format "{{.Status}}"
  → [AI Agent: Analyze Plex Health]
  → [Code: Check if Action Needed]
  → [IF: Plex Down]
       YES → [Telegram: Alert]
             → [AI Agent: Propose Restart]
             → [Wait for Approval]
             → [Execute Command: docker restart plex]
             → [Wait: 30 seconds]
             → [HTTP Request: Verify Recovery]
             → [Telegram: Confirm]
       NO → [End]
```

#### Example Agent Interaction

```
User: "Why is Plex slow?"

Agent: "Investigating Plex performance..."

[Checks HTTP health]
[Checks container status]
[Checks active sessions]
[Checks resource usage]

Agent: "🎬 Plex Performance Analysis:

Server Status: ONLINE but under heavy load

Active Streams: 3
1. User: John - Avatar (4K) → Transcoding to 1080p
2. User: Sarah - The Office S3E2 (1080p) → Direct Play
3. User: Kids_iPad - Frozen (1080p) → Transcoding to 720p

Resource Usage:
CPU: 178% (1.78 cores) ⚠️ HIGH
RAM: 3.2GB / 4GB (80%)
Transcode Directory: 8.2GB

Root Cause: 
2 simultaneous transcodes from 4K/1080p content.
CPU at capacity, causing buffering.

Recommendations:
1. SHORT-TERM: Ask one user to pause temporarily
2. MEDIUM-TERM: Encourage direct play (matching client capabilities)
3. LONG-TERM: Consider GPU transcoding (QuickSync/NVENC)

Current Bottleneck: CPU-bound transcoding

Would you like me to:
A) Send message to John about 4K transcode load
B) Check transcoding settings
C) Monitor and alert if streams drop"
```

### Section 6.6: Integration Best Practices

**Security**:
- Store API keys and tokens in n8n credentials, never in code
- Use read-only accounts initially
- Implement IP whitelisting where possible
- Rotate credentials quarterly

**Reliability**:
- Implement timeouts for all API calls (10-30 seconds)
- Add retry logic for transient failures (3 retries with exponential backoff)
- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API load

**Performance**:
- Poll less frequently for non-critical services (15-30 minutes)
- Use webhooks instead of polling where supported
- Batch related API calls

**Maintainability**:
- Document each integration's endpoints and authentication
- Create separate subworkflows for complex integrations
- Version control your workflow exports

---

With these integrations in place, your AI agent has deep visibility into every aspect of your homelab. In Chapter 7, we'll explore advanced features like God-Mode prompts and multi-agent collaboration.

## Chapter 7 – Advanced Features

This chapter explores sophisticated capabilities that transform your agent system from a monitoring tool into an intelligent infrastructure management platform. These features are powerful but require careful consideration of safety implications.

### Section 7.1: Human Approval Loop (Deep Dive)

The approval loop is your safety net. This section provides detailed implementation for bulletproof human-in-the-loop automation.

```

#### Implementation: Approval Storage

Use n8n's workflow static data or external database to track pending approvals.

**Option 1: Workflow Static Data** (Simple, built-in)
```javascript
// In Code node - Store Pending Approval
const approvalId = `APR-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;

const approval = {
  id: approvalId,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  service: $json.service.name,
  issue: $json.diagnosis.root_cause,
  command: $json.proposed_action.command,
  severity: $json.severity,
  status: 'pending'
};

// Store in workflow static data
const staticData = $('WorkflowStaticData').first().json;
if (!staticData.pending_approvals) {
  staticData.pending_approvals = {};
}
staticData.pending_approvals[approvalId] = approval;

return {
  json: {
    approval_id: approvalId,
    ...approval
  }
};
```

**Option 2: External File/Database** (More robust)
```javascript
// Store in JSON file
const fs = require('fs');
const approvalsFile = '/tmp/pending_approvals.json';

let approvals = {};
if (fs.existsSync(approvalsFile)) {
  approvals = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(approvalsFile, 'utf8'));
}

const approvalId = `APR-${Date.now()}`;
approvals[approvalId] = {
  id: approvalId,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  service: $json.service.name,
  issue: $json.diagnosis.root_cause,
  command: $json.proposed_action.command,
  severity: $json.severity,
  status: 'pending'
};

fs.writeFileSync(approvalsFile, JSON.stringify(approvals, null, 2));

return { json: { approval_id: approvalId } };
```

#### Telegram Message with Approval ID

```javascript
// Build Telegram message with approval context
const message = `
🚨 APPROVAL REQUEST

ID: ${$json.approval_id}
Service: ${$json.service.name}
Severity: ${$json.severity.toUpperCase()}
Detected: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}

Issue:
${$json.diagnosis.root_cause}

Proposed Fix:
\`\`\`
${$json.proposed_action.command}
\`\`\`

Impact:
• Downtime: ${$json.proposed_action.estimated_downtime}
• Risk: ${$json.proposed_action.risk_level.toUpperCase()}

To approve: Reply "YES ${$json.approval_id}"
To decline: Reply "NO ${$json.approval_id}"
For details: Reply "EXPLAIN ${$json.approval_id}"

Expires in: 30 minutes
`;

return { json: { message } };
```

#### Approval Response Workflow

```
[Telegram Trigger: On Message]
  ↓
[Code: Parse Response]
```

```javascript
// Parse user response
const message = $input.first().json.message.text;
const match = message.match(/^(YES|NO|EXPLAIN)\s+([A-Z0-9\-]+)$/i);

if (!match) {
  return []; // Invalid format, ignore
}

const [, action, approvalId] = match;

// Retrieve pending approval
const staticData = $('WorkflowStaticData').first().json;
const approval = staticData.pending_approvals?.[approvalId];

if (!approval) {
  // Send error to Telegram
  return {
    json: {
      error: `Approval ${approvalId} not found or already processed.`
    }
  };
}

// Check if expired (30 minutes)
const approvalTime = new Date(approval.timestamp);
const now = new Date();
const minutesElapsed = (now - approvalTime) / 1000 / 60;

if (minutesElapsed > 30) {
  delete staticData.pending_approvals[approvalId];
  return {
    json: {
      error: `Approval ${approvalId} has expired (30 min limit).`
    }
  };
}

return {
  json: {
    action: action.toUpperCase(),
    approval,
    is_valid: true
  }
};
```

```
  ↓
[Switch: Action Type]
  ├─ YES → [Execute Command] → [Telegram: Confirm Success]
  ├─ NO  → [Telegram: Acknowledge Denial] → [Log to File]
  └─ EXPLAIN → [AI Agent: Detailed Explanation] → [Telegram: Send Details]
```

#### Approval Expiration & Cleanup

```javascript
// Periodic cleanup job (runs every hour)
const staticData = $('WorkflowStaticData').first().json;
const approvals = staticData.pending_approvals || {};
const now = new Date();

Object.keys(approvals).forEach(id => {
  const approval = approvals[id];
  const approvalTime = new Date(approval.timestamp);
  const hoursElapsed = (now - approvalTime) / 1000 / 60 / 60;
  
  if (hoursElapsed > 1) {
    // Expired, remove
    delete approvals[id];
  }
});

return { json: { cleaned: true, remaining: Object.keys(approvals).length } };
```

### Section 7.2: God-Mode Prompt (⚠️ Use with Extreme Caution!)

**God-Mode** grants your agent autonomous decision-making and execution capabilities without human approval for routine issues. This is extremely powerful but carries significant risks.

#### ⚠️ Critical Warnings

**BEFORE ENABLING GOD-MODE:**

1. **Test extensively** (minimum 4 weeks in Stage 5 with approvals)
2. **Start with ONE non-critical service** only
3. **Implement comprehensive logging** (every action recorded)
4. **Set up independent monitoring** (monitor the monitor)
5. **Have kill-switch ready** (ability to disable instantly)
6. **Backup everything** (configurations, data, workflows)
7. **Define strict boundaries** (whitelist of allowed actions)
8. **Never use on**: Databases, storage systems, production apps initially

**RISKS:**
- Cascading failures (agent fixes one thing, breaks another)
- Runaway automation (restart loops, resource exhaustion)
- Unintended consequences (agent misinterprets situation)
- Loss of visibility (changes happen without notification)
- Compliance violations (unauthorized changes in regulated environments)

#### God-Mode System Prompt Template

```
ROLE: Autonomous Homelab Infrastructure Agent (God-Mode)

CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: You have autonomous execution authority within defined boundaries.
Every action MUST be logged, justified, and reversible.

AUTHORITY LEVEL: FULL (within whitelist)

ALLOWED AUTONOMOUS ACTIONS:
1. Service Restarts
   - Docker containers: website, plex, monitoring
   - Condition: Container stopped/crashed, not in restart loop
   - Max attempts: 1 per hour per service
   
2. Resource Cleanup
   - Clear Docker logs if >5GB
   - Remove old container images (>30 days unused)
   - Clear transcode directories if >50GB
   
3. Network Remediation
   - Restart network services if connectivity lost
   - Reset DHCP leases for specific devices
   - Flush DNS cache

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (ALWAYS require approval):
❌ Database operations (stop, restart, modify)
❌ Storage modifications (RAID, ZFS pools, disk operations)
❌ User account changes
❌ Firewall rule modifications
❌ Certificate operations
❌ VM/Container creation or deletion
❌ Any operation on production-critical services
❌ Actions affecting more than 1 service simultaneously

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
For each issue:
1. Assess severity (low/medium/high/critical)
2. Check if action is in ALLOWED list
3. Verify conditions are met (not in loop, etc.)
4. If ALLOWED: Execute immediately with logging
5. If FORBIDDEN: Request human approval
6. If UNCERTAIN: Request human approval (err on side of caution)

LOGGING REQUIREMENT:
Every action MUST produce a log entry:
{
  "timestamp": "[ISO 8601]",
  "action_id": "[unique ID]",
  "action_type": "[restart/cleanup/network/etc]",
  "target": "[service name]",
  "reason": "[diagnosis summary]",
  "command_executed": "[exact command]",
  "result": "[success/failure]",
  "verification": "[post-action check result]",
  "approved_by": "autonomous (god-mode)",
  "rollback_command": "[how to undo if needed]"
}

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
Immediately notify human (even in god-mode) if:
- Action failed to resolve issue
- Same service fails >2 times in 1 hour
- Multiple services affected simultaneously
- Any FORBIDDEN action needed
- Uncertainty about correct course of action

SELF-MONITORING:
Track your own statistics:
- Actions taken per day
- Success rate (should be >95%)
- False positive rate
- Time to resolution
If success rate drops below 90%, request human review.

COMMUNICATION:
- Log all actions to file: /var/log/n8n-agent-actions.log
- Send daily summary to Telegram
- Send immediate notification for:
  * Critical issues
  * Failed autonomous actions
  * Escalations requiring human intervention

EXAMPLE AUTONOMOUS ACTION:
Issue: Website container stopped
Assessment: 
  - Service: website (whitelisted)
  - Action: restart (allowed)
  - Loop check: Last restart >1 hour ago ✓
  - Diagnosis: Clean shutdown, no errors
Decision: Execute autonomous restart
Command: docker restart website
Verification: HTTP 200 OK after 15 seconds
Logging: Action logged with ID AUT-20240115-001
Notification: None (routine fix)

EXAMPLE ESCALATION:
Issue: Database container stopped
Assessment:
  - Service: database (FORBIDDEN for auto-action)
Decision: Escalate to human
Action: Send approval request with:
  - Full diagnosis
  - Proposed fix
  - Risk assessment
  - Urgency: HIGH (production database)
Wait: For human decision

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility. When in doubt, ask.
Your goal is to be helpful, not heroic. Humans make final decisions on anything uncertain.
```

#### God-Mode Workflow Structure

```
[Schedule Trigger: Every 5 minutes]
  ↓
[AI Agent: God-Mode Monitoring]
  (Uses above system prompt)
  ↓
[Code: Parse Agent Output]
  ↓
[Switch: Action Taken Type]
  ├─ autonomous_fix → [Log Action]
  │                   → [Verify Success]
  │                   → [Update Statistics]
  ├─ requires_approval → [Send Telegram Approval]
  │                      → [Wait for Response]
  └─ no_action → [End]
```

#### God-Mode Action Logging

```javascript
// Log every autonomous action to file
const fs = require('fs');
const logFile = '/var/log/n8n-agent-actions.log';

const logEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  action_id: `AUT-${Date.now()}`,
  action_type: $json.action_type,
  target: $json.target_service,
  reason: $json.diagnosis,
  command: $json.command_executed,
  result: $json.result,
  approved_by: 'autonomous (god-mode)',
  verification: $json.verification_status,
  rollback: $json.rollback_command
};

// Append to log file
fs.appendFileSync(
  logFile, 
  JSON.stringify(logEntry) + '\n'
);

// Also send to Telegram for critical actions
if ($json.severity === 'high' || $json.severity === 'critical') {
  return {
    json: {
      ...logEntry,
      send_notification: true,
      notification_message: `
🤖 Autonomous Action Taken

Service: ${logEntry.target}
Action: ${logEntry.action_type}
Reason: ${logEntry.reason}
Result: ${logEntry.result}

Full details logged: ${logEntry.action_id}
      `
    }
  };
}

return { json: logEntry };
```

#### Daily Summary Report

```javascript
// Generate daily summary of autonomous actions
// Run once per day via schedule trigger

const fs = require('fs');
const logFile = '/var/log/n8n-agent-actions.log';

// Read last 24 hours of logs
const logs = fs.readFileSync(logFile, 'utf8')
  .split('\n')
  .filter(line => line.trim())
  .map(line => JSON.parse(line))
  .filter(entry => {
    const entryTime = new Date(entry.timestamp);
    const oneDayAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    return entryTime > oneDayAgo;
  });

// Calculate statistics
const totalActions = logs.length;
const successCount = logs.filter(l => l.result === 'success').length;
const failureCount = logs.filter(l => l.result === 'failure').length;
const successRate = totalActions > 0 ? (successCount / totalActions * 100).toFixed(1) : 0;

// Group by service
const byService = {};
logs.forEach(log => {
  if (!byService[log.target]) byService[log.target] = 0;
  byService[log.target]++;
});

// Build report
const report = `
📊 Autonomous Agent Daily Report
${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}

Actions Taken: ${totalActions}
✅ Successful: ${successCount}
❌ Failed: ${failureCount}
Success Rate: ${successRate}%

By Service:
${Object.entries(byService)
  .map(([service, count]) => `  • ${service}: ${count} actions`)
  .join('\n')}

${successRate < 90 ? '⚠️ WARNING: Success rate below 90%. Review needed.' : ''}

Full logs: /var/log/n8n-agent-actions.log
`;

return {
  json: {
    report,
    statistics: {
      total: totalActions,
      success: successCount,
      failure: failureCount,
      success_rate: successRate
    }
  }
};
```

#### Kill Switch Implementation

Create a simple way to disable god-mode instantly:

**Method 1: Environment Variable**
```javascript
// At start of God-Mode workflow
const godModeEnabled = $env.GOD_MODE_ENABLED === 'true';

if (!godModeEnabled) {
  return {
    json: {
      message: 'God-Mode is disabled. Switching to approval-required mode.',
      mode: 'human-in-loop'
    }
  };
}

// Continue with god-mode logic...
```

To disable: Set `GOD_MODE_ENABLED=false` in n8n environment variables

**Method 2: File-Based Kill Switch**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const killSwitchFile = '/tmp/n8n-god-mode-kill-switch';

if (fs.existsSync(killSwitchFile)) {
  return {
    json: {
      error: 'KILL SWITCH ACTIVATED - God-Mode disabled',
      instructions: 'Remove file to re-enable: rm /tmp/n8n-god-mode-kill-switch'
    }
  };
}
```

To disable: `touch /tmp/n8n-god-mode-kill-switch`

### Section 7.3: Agent Collaboration

Multiple specialized agents working together on complex problems.

#### Collaboration Architecture

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐

        │  Knowledge      │       │  Firewall      │
        └─────────────────┘       └────────────────┘
```

#### Implementation Pattern

**Orchestrator Workflow** (Vishnu - CTO):
```
[Schedule Trigger or Webhook]
  ↓
[AI Agent: Vishnu - Analyze Issue]
  System Prompt: "You are the CTO. Analyze the issue and determine which specialist agent(s) to consult."
  ↓
[Code: Determine Specialist Needed]
  ↓
[Switch: Route to Specialist]
  ├─ network_issue → [Execute Workflow: Brahma Network Agent]
  ├─ deployment_issue → [Execute Workflow: Shiva DevOps Agent]
  ├─ database_issue → [Execute Workflow: Saraswati DB Agent]
  └─ security_issue → [Execute Workflow: Ganesha Security Agent]
  ↓
[AI Agent: Vishnu - Synthesize Recommendations]
  ↓
[Telegram: Present Unified Solution]
```

**Specialist Agent Workflow** (Example: Brahma - Network):
```
[Execute Workflow Trigger]
  Input: Problem description
  ↓
[AI Agent: Brahma Network Specialist]
  System Prompt: "You are a network infrastructure expert. Analyze network-related issues."
  Tools: 
    - SSH to UniFi Controller
    - Network diagnostic commands
    - Bandwidth analysis tools
  ↓
[Code: Prepare Specialist Report]
  ↓
[Respond to Workflow]
  Output: Diagnosis + Recommendations
```

#### Shared Knowledge Base

Implement shared context across agents:

```javascript
// Shared knowledge file
const fs = require('fs');
const knowledgeFile = '/tmp/agent-knowledge-base.json';

// Load existing knowledge
let knowledge = {};
if (fs.existsSync(knowledgeFile)) {
  knowledge = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(knowledgeFile, 'utf8'));
}

// Add new knowledge
const newEntry = {

if (knowledge.entries.length > 100) {
  knowledge.entries = knowledge.entries.slice(-100);
}

fs.writeFileSync(knowledgeFile, JSON.stringify(knowledge, null, 2));

return { json: { knowledge_updated: true } };
```

#### Agent Handoff Protocol

When one agent determines another is better suited:

```
Agent A (Brahma - Network): 
"I've diagnosed a network connectivity issue, but the root cause appears to be 
a firewall rule blocking traffic. This falls under Ganesha's security domain. 
Escalating to Ganesha for firewall analysis."

↓ Handoff ↓

Agent B (Ganesha - Security):
"Received handoff from Brahma regarding firewall blocking port 32400.
Analyzing firewall rules..."
"Identified: Plex port 32400 is blocked in firewall after recent security update.
Proposed fix: Add exception for Plex on local network."
```

#### Collaborative Problem Solving Example

**Scenario**: Plex is slow for remote users but fine locally

```
1. Hanuman (Helpdesk) receives user complaint:
   "Remote Plex access is extremely slow"

2. Hanuman escalates to Vishnu (CTO):
   "Issue type: Performance degradation, scope: Remote only"

3. Vishnu delegates:
   - Brahma (Network): Check bandwidth and routing
   - Shiva (DevOps): Check Plex container resources
   - Saraswati (Knowledge): Check similar past issues

4. Brahma reports:
   "Network Analysis:
   - Local bandwidth: 1Gbps, normal
   - WAN upload: 40Mbps, saturated at 39Mbps
   - Cause: Multiple simultaneous transcodes consuming all upload bandwidth"

5. Shiva reports:
   "Container Analysis:
   - CPU: 85% (transcoding)
   - RAM: Normal
   - Transcoding 3 simultaneous 4K→1080p streams"

6. Saraswati reports:
   "Knowledge Base Search:
   - Similar issue resolved 2 months ago
   - Solution: Limit remote stream quality to 720p or enable hardware transcoding"

7. Vishnu synthesizes:
   "ROOT CAUSE: Upload bandwidth saturation from 4K transcoding
   
   RECOMMENDATIONS (in order):
   A. Immediate: Limit remote quality to 2Mbps 720p (no infrastructure change)
   B. Short-term: Enable Intel QuickSync transcoding (reduces CPU load, same bandwidth)
   C. Long-term: Upgrade ISP upload speed to 100Mbps
   
   Estimated impact of A: Reduces bandwidth per stream from 13Mbps to 2Mbps,
   allowing 20 concurrent streams instead of 3.
   
   Approve solution A for immediate deployment?"
```

This collaborative approach solves complex issues more effectively than a single monolithic agent.

## Chapter 8 – AI Team

Building a complete AI-powered IT department requires more than individual agents—it demands a thoughtfully designed team with specialized roles, clear responsibilities, and cosmic wisdom. This chapter presents the **n8n AI Team**, where each agent embodies the qualities of Hindu deities, translating ancient archetypes into modern infrastructure management.

### Section 8.1: Philosophy - From Mythology to Technology

In Hindu cosmology, the universe operates through divine forces, each with specific roles in creation, preservation, and transformation. This mirrors an IT department where different roles maintain, build, and evolve infrastructure.

The **n8n AI Team** maps these cosmic principles to technical responsibilities:

- **Creation** (Brahma) → Building infrastructure, networks, storage
- **Preservation** (Vishnu) → Maintaining stability, uptime, monitoring
- **Transformation** (Shiva) → Deploying changes, DevOps, continuous improvement
- **Knowledge** (Saraswati) → Documentation, databases, learning
- **Problem-Solving** (Ganesha) → Removing obstacles, security, access control
- **Service** (Hanuman) → Support, dedication, user assistance

This isn't mere metaphor—each deity's characteristics inform the agent's decision-making framework, priorities, and personality.

INITIAL CHECK:
Database: postgres-main
Status: Online ✅
Connections: 45/100 (healthy)

SLOW QUERY DETECTION:
Analyzing recent queries...
Found: 3 queries >2 seconds in last hour

SLOWEST QUERY:
SELECT * FROM articles 
  JOIN users ON articles.author_id = users.id 
  JOIN comments ON comments.article_id = articles.id
WHERE published = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC
Average execution: 3.8 seconds 🐌

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Missing index on comments.article_id
2. SELECT * fetching unnecessary columns
3. Lack of limit clause (fetching all results)

RECOMMENDED OPTIMIZATIONS:
```sql
-- Add missing index
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_article_id ON comments(article_id);

-- Optimized query
SELECT articles.id, articles.title, articles.created_at,
       users.username,
       COUNT(comments.id) as comment_count
FROM articles 
  JOIN users ON articles.author_id = users.id 
  LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.article_id = articles.id
WHERE published = true
GROUP BY articles.id, users.id
ORDER BY articles.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
Execution time: 3.8s → <0.1s (38x faster)

APPROVAL REQUEST:
May I create the missing index? This is a non-destructive optimization.
The index creation will take ~10 seconds and improve query performance significantly.

Please reply: YES to proceed, NO to decline, EXPLAIN for technical details."

✅ Fail2ban active (IP will auto-ban after 5 failures)
✅ Non-standard SSH port (22 → should migrate to 2222)

AUTO-ACTION TAKEN:
Fail2ban has banned 45.123.67.89 for 24 hours

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Current Risk: LOW (key auth prevents compromise)
- Attack Type: Automated script (common internet noise)
- Recommendation: Not urgent, but suggest improvements

RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Change SSH port from 22 to custom (e.g., 2222)
   - Reduces automated attacks by ~95%
   - Command: Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change Port 22 to Port 2222
   
2. Enable GeoIP blocking for SSH (allow only your country)
   - Further reduces attack surface
   
3. Install Crowdsec for collaborative threat intelligence
   - Shares threat data with community

### Section 8.5: Benefits of the Team Approach

**Compared to Single Monolithic Agent**:

| Aspect | Single Agent | AI Team |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Expertise | Generalist, shallow knowledge | Specialists with deep expertise |
| Prompt Size | Huge, unwieldy | Focused, maintainable |
| Decision Quality | Generic solutions | Domain-optimized solutions |
| Scalability | Degrades with complexity | Scales with specialization |
| Debugging | Hard to identify failure point | Clear responsibility boundaries |
| Learning | Broad but unfocused | Targeted improvement per role |
| Collaboration | N/A | Specialists consult and handoff |

**Real-World Benefit Example**:

*Single Agent Approach*:
```
User: "Network is slow"
Agent: "Checking... network seems fine. Maybe restart router?"
→ Generic, unhelpful response
```

*Team Approach*:
```
User: "Network is slow"
Hanuman: Routes to Brahma (Network)
Brahma: Investigates → "UniFi AP in living room is experiencing 85% channel utilization"
Brahma: Routes to Vishnu → "Interference from neighbor's network"
Vishnu: Consults Brahma → "Recommend channel change from 6 to 11"
Brahma: Changes channel, verifies improvement
Hanuman: Updates user → "Fixed! Changed Wi-Fi channel due to interference. Speed should improve."
→ Expert diagnosis and solution
```

## Chapter 9 – Troubleshooting

Even the most sophisticated AI agent systems encounter issues. This chapter provides systematic troubleshooting approaches, common problems, solutions, and JSON examples to help you diagnose and resolve problems quickly.

### Section 9.1: General Troubleshooting Methodology

**Before diving into specific issues, follow this systematic approach**:

1. **Identify the Symptom**: What exactly is not working?
2. **Isolate the Component**: Is it the workflow, agent, tool, or service?
3. **Check the Logs**: n8n execution logs, agent responses, service logs
4. **Reproduce the Issue**: Can you trigger it manually?
5. **Test Components Individually**: Execute nodes one at a time
6. **Verify Configuration**: Check credentials, URLs, parameters
7. **Consult Documentation**: Review this guide and n8n docs
8. **Escalate if Needed**: Community forums, GitHub issues

---

### Section 9.2: n8n Workflow Errors

#### Problem: Variable Mapping Errors

**Symptom**:
```
Error: Cannot read property 'chatId' of undefined
Error: $json.output is not defined
Error: Expression error: Variable 'prompt' is not defined
```

**Cause**: Data structure mismatch between nodes. A node expects data that the previous node didn't provide.

**Solution**:

1. **Execute Previous Node First**:
   - Click "Execute Node" on the node BEFORE the failing one
   - Inspect the output in JSON tab
   - Verify it contains the expected fields

2. **Check Data Mapping**:
```javascript
// WRONG - assuming structure without checking
const message = $json.result.message.text;

// RIGHT - safe access with fallbacks
const message = $json?.result?.message?.text || 'No message';
```

3. **Use Expression Editor**:
   - Click the "Expression" toggle when mapping variables
   - Browse available variables in the left panel
   - Test expressions before saving

4. **Add Data Transformation Node**:
```javascript
// Code node to restructure data
return {
  json: {
    chatId: $input.first().json.message.chat.id,
    prompt: $input.first().json.agent_output.text,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
};
```

**Example Fix**:
```
[AI Agent] → Output: { output: "Service is down" }
          ↓
[Code: Extract & Restructure]
```
```javascript
const agentResponse = $input.first().json.output;
return {
  json: {
    message: agentResponse,
    chatId: $env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
};
```
```
          ↓
[Telegram] → Now has chatId and message properly mapped
```

---

#### Problem: Too Many Tool Calls / Iteration Limit Exceeded

**Symptom**:
```
Error: Max iterations (10) reached for AI Agent
Agent seems to call tools repeatedly without completing
Workflow times out
```

**Cause**: Agent is stuck in a loop, repeatedly calling tools without reaching a conclusion.

**Root Causes**:
1. Unclear system prompt (agent doesn't know when it's "done")
2. Tool returning confusing output
3. Agent trying to solve unsolvable problem
4. Insufficient max iterations for complex task

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Clarify System Prompt**
```
// VAGUE
"Check services and fix issues"

// CLEAR
"Check services using HTTP request tool. 
If status is 200, respond: 'Service is UP'.
If status is not 200, respond: 'Service is DOWN'.
Do NOT take any other actions. Stop after checking."
```

**Solution 2: Increase Max Iterations** (for legitimate complex tasks)
```
AI Agent Settings → Options → Max Iterations: 20
```

**Solution 3: Add Completion Criteria to Prompt**
```
COMPLETION CRITERIA:
You have completed your task when:
- You have checked all required services
- You have generated a status report
- You have sent any necessary notifications

After completing these steps, STOP. Do not continue checking.
```

**Solution 4: Simplify the Task**
```
// Instead of: "Monitor all services and fix any issues"
// Use: "Check Plex service status only"

Then create separate workflows for different services
rather than one mega-workflow.
```

---

#### Problem: Workflow Not Triggering on Schedule

**Symptom**:
- Schedule trigger configured but workflow doesn't execute
- No executions appearing in history
- Workflow seems inactive

**Solution**:

1. **Verify Workflow is Active**:
   - Workflow must be toggled ON (switch in top right)
   - Inactive workflows don't execute scheduled triggers

2. **Check Schedule Configuration**:
```
WRONG: "Every 5 minutes" with no cron expression
RIGHT: 
  - Cron Expression: */5 * * * *
  - Mode: Every X minutes
  - Interval: 5
```

3. **Verify n8n is Running**:
```bash
# Check n8n process
ps aux | grep n8n

# Check n8n logs
docker logs n8n  # if running in Docker
journalctl -u n8n  # if running as service
```

4. **Check Timezone**:
```
Schedule trigger uses server timezone.
If scheduling for "9 AM" but nothing happens,
verify server time matches your expectation:

date
timedatectl  # on Linux
```

5. **Test with Manual Trigger First**:
   - Add a Manual Trigger alongside Schedule Trigger
   - Test workflow manually
   - Once working, remove Manual Trigger

---

### Section 9.3: Telegram Integration Issues

#### Problem: Telegram Not Responding / Messages Not Sending

**Symptom**:
- Telegram node completes without error but no message received
- "Chat not found" error
- Messages sent to wrong chat

**Solutions**:

**Issue 1: Incorrect Chat ID**

```bash
# Verify your Chat ID
# Method 1: Send message to bot, then check:
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates

# Look for your chat ID in response:
{
  "result": [{
    "message": {
      "chat": {
        "id": 123456789,  ← This is your Chat ID
```

**Issue 2: Bot Not Started**

Solution: Open Telegram, search for your bot, click "START" button

**Issue 3: Wrong Token**

```javascript
// Verify token in n8n credential matches BotFather
// Test token manually:
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getMe

// Should return bot info, not "Unauthorized"
```

**Issue 4: Bot Blocked by User**

If you previously blocked the bot, unblock it in Telegram:
- Open chat with bot
- Click bot name → Unblock

**Example Working Configuration**:
```
Telegram Node:
- Credential: [Your bot credential]
- Chat ID: 123456789 (your actual chat ID, not variable)
- Message: Test message

Test with this simple message first, then add variables.
```

---

#### Problem: Telegram Trigger Not Receiving Messages

**Symptom**:
- Telegram Trigger workflow exists but doesn't activate when you message bot
- No executions appear when sending messages

**Solutions**:

1. **Webhook Mode vs Polling**:
```
n8n supports two modes:
- Webhook (production): Requires public URL
- Polling (development): n8n polls Telegram API

For local development:
Settings → Telegram Trigger → Mode: Polling

For production with public n8n:
Mode: Webhook
Webhook URL will be auto-configured
```

2. **Verify Webhook Registration**:
```bash
# Check current webhook
curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo

# Should show your n8n webhook URL
# If not, or shows wrong URL, delete and recreate Telegram Trigger node
```

3. **Workflow Must Be Active**:
   - Telegram Triggers only work when workflow is ACTIVE
   - Toggle workflow ON

4. **Test Webhook Directly**:
```bash
# Simulate Telegram sending update
curl -X POST https://your-n8n.com/webhook/telegram \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":{"text":"test","chat":{"id":123456789}}}'
```

### Section 9.4: SSH Connection Failures

#### Problem: Cannot Execute Remote Commands

**Symptom**:
```
Error: Connection refused
Error: Permission denied (publickey)
Error: Host key verification failed
```

**Solutions**:

**Issue 1: SSH Key Not Configured**

```bash
# On n8n server, generate key if needed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "n8n-agent"

# Copy to target server
ssh-copy-id user@target-server

# Test manually
ssh user@target-server "echo 'success'"
```

**Issue 2: Wrong User/Host**

```javascript
// In Execute Command node
Command: ssh user@192.168.1.100 "docker ps"

// Verify:
// - User exists on target server
// - IP address is correct
// - Server is reachable (ping 192.168.1.100)
```

**Issue 3: Subworkflow Command Mapping**

```javascript
// When using subworkflow for SSH commands

// Main workflow passes:
{ "command": "docker ps" }

// Subworkflow should use:
Command: ssh user@target "{{ $json.command }}"

// NOT:
Command: ssh user@target {{ $json.command }}  ❌ Missing quotes
```

**Issue 4: Host Key Verification**

```bash
# First time connecting to server
# Add to known_hosts

# Option 1: Accept manually
ssh user@server  # Type 'yes' when prompted

# Option 2: Add to SSH config (less secure but convenient)
# Create ~/.ssh/config
Host *
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

**Example Working SSH Subworkflow**:
```
[Execute Workflow Trigger]
  Input: { "server": "proxmox", "command": "pvesh get /nodes/pve/status" }
  ↓
[Execute Command: SSH]
  Command: ssh root@{{ $json.server }}.local "{{ $json.command }}"
  ↓
[Code: Parse Output]
  Parse JSON or text response
  ↓
[Respond to Workflow]
  Return structured data
```

### Section 9.5: Docker Permission Issues

#### Problem: Cannot Execute Docker Commands

**Symptom**:
```
Error: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
Error: docker: command not found
Cannot restart container
```

**Solutions**:

**Issue 1: User Not in Docker Group**

```bash
# Add n8n user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker n8n-user

# Or if n8n runs as different user
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Logout and login again, or:
newgrp docker

# Test
docker ps  # Should work without sudo
```

**Issue 2: Docker Socket Permissions**

```bash
# Check socket permissions
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock

# Should be: srw-rw---- 1 root docker

# If wrong:
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock  # Quick fix (insecure)
# OR better:
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
```

**Issue 3: Docker Not Installed/Running**

```bash
# Check if Docker is running
systemctl status docker

# Start Docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Enable on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Verify
docker ps
```

**Issue 4: n8n in Docker Can't Access Host Docker**

```yaml
# If n8n runs in Docker and needs to control host Docker
# Mount Docker socket in n8n container

docker-compose.yml:
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    volumes:
      - ./n8n-data:/home/node/.n8n
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  ← Add this
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
```

---

### Section 9.6: Agent Not Making Decisions

#### Problem: Agent Seems Stuck or Unresponsive

**Symptom**:
- Agent returns empty responses
- Agent says "I don't know" to everything
- Agent doesn't use tools even when available

**Solutions**:

**Issue 1: System Prompt Too Vague**

```
// TOO VAGUE
"You are a helpful assistant"

// SPECIFIC
"You are a homelab monitoring agent.
Your task is to check service health using the HTTP Request tool.
When asked about a service:
1. Use HTTP Request to check the URL
2. Report the status code
3. Indicate if service is UP (200-299) or DOWN (other)
Always use tools when available."
```

**Issue 2: LLM API Issues**

```javascript
// Check API key validity
// Test outside n8n:
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'

// Should return chat completion, not error
```

**Issue 3: Model Selection**

```
Some models are better for agent tasks:
- GPT-4o-mini ✅ (cost-effective, capable)
- GPT-4 ✅ (most capable)
- GPT-3.5-turbo ⚠️ (less reliable for complex agent tasks)

Avoid deprecated models.
```

**Issue 4: Tools Not Properly Connected**

```
In AI Agent node:
- Click "Add Tool"
- Select HTTP Request (or other tool)
- VERIFY tool node appears connected
- Tool node should have line connecting to AI Agent

If disconnected, delete and re-add tool.
```

**Issue 5: Insufficient Context**

```javascript
// Agent needs enough information to decide

// INSUFFICIENT
User: "Check it"
Agent: "Check what?"

// SUFFICIENT
User: "Check if Plex at http://192.168.1.100:32400 is online"
Agent: [Uses HTTP tool and responds]

// Add context in system prompt:
"When user says 'check the website', they mean http://192.168.1.100:8090"
```

---

### Section 9.7: JSON Parsing Issues

#### Problem: Invalid JSON from Agent

**Symptom**:
```
Error: Unexpected token in JSON at position 0
Agent returns text instead of JSON
JSON fields missing or incorrectly formatted
```

**Example Invalid Responses**:
```
The service is down. Here's the report:
{
  "status": "down"
}

// Issue: Extra text before JSON


{
  status: "down",  // Missing quotes around key
  message: 'Service offline'  // Single quotes instead of double
}


{
  "status": "down",
  "diagnosis": {
    "reason": "Container stopped"
  }  // Missing closing brace
```

**Solution: Robust JSON Extraction**

```javascript
// Code node: Parse Agent Output
const agentOutput = $input.first().json.output;

// Extract JSON from response (handles extra text)
function extractJSON(text) {
  try {
    // Try direct parse first
    return JSON.parse(text);
  } catch (e) {
    // Extract JSON object from text
    const jsonMatch = text.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/);
    if (jsonMatch) {
      try {
        return JSON.parse(jsonMatch[0]);
      } catch (e2) {
        // JSON is malformed
        return null;
      }
    }
    return null;
  }
}

const report = extractJSON(agentOutput);

if (!report) {
  // Fallback if JSON parsing fails
  return {
    json: {
      status: "error",
      raw_output: agentOutput,
      error: "Failed to parse JSON from agent"
    }
  };
}

// Validate required fields
const validatedReport = {
  status: report.status || "unknown",
  service: report.service || { name: "unknown" },
  diagnosis: report.diagnosis || { root_cause: "N/A" },
  timestamp: report.timestamp || new Date().toISOString()
};

return { json: validatedReport };
```

**Improve Agent JSON Output**:

Add to system prompt:
```
OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:
You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No other text.

CORRECT:
{"status":"down","service":"plex"}

INCORRECT:
Here's the status:
{"status":"down"}

INCORRECT:
{status: "down"}

INCORRECT:
{'status': 'down'}

Rules:
- Use double quotes for keys and string values
- No trailing commas
- No comments in JSON
- No text before or after JSON object
```

## Chapter 10 – Best Practices

Professional infrastructure management requires discipline, planning, and adherence to proven practices. This chapter distills wisdom from production deployments into actionable guidelines.

### Section 10.1: Development Workflow

**Progressive Implementation**:

1. **Start Simple** (Week 1-2):
   - Single service monitoring (test website)
   - Manual trigger only
   - Basic HTTP health checks
   - No automation, just observation

2. **Add Intelligence** (Week 3-4):
   - Diagnostic capabilities (Docker logs)
   - Structured JSON output
   - Basic Telegram notifications
   - Still manual execution

3. **Automate Carefully** (Week 5-6):
   - Schedule trigger (every 30 minutes initially)
   - Rate limiting and deduplication
   - Human-in-the-loop approvals
   - Comprehensive logging

4. **Expand Scope** (Week 7+):
   - Additional services one at a time
   - Specialized agents for different domains
   - Agent collaboration
   - Refinement based on experience

**Testing Hierarchy**:
```
1. Local Development
   ↓ (Test thoroughly)
2. Staging/Test Services
   ↓ (Validate behavior)
3. Non-Critical Production
   ↓ (Monitor closely)
4. Critical Production
   ↓ (Only after proven reliable)
```

**Never Skip Steps**. Each phase builds confidence and reveals edge cases.

---

### Section 10.2: Security Considerations

**Principle of Least Privilege**:

```
Agent Capability Levels:

Level 1 (Read-Only):
- HTTP GET requests
- Log viewing
- Status checks
✅ Safe for production immediately

Level 2 (Safe Operations):
- Container restarts
- Cache clearing
- Log rotation
⚠️ Requires testing, generally safe

Level 3 (Configuration Changes):
- Firewall rules
- Resource limits
- Port mappings
❌ Requires approval, staging testing

Level 4 (Data Operations):
- Database modifications
- Storage operations
- User management
🔴 FORBIDDEN for automation
```

**Credential Management**:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk-abc123xyz789";
const dbPassword = "MyPassword123";

// ✅ RIGHT - Environment variables
const apiKey = $env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
const dbPassword = $env.DATABASE_PASSWORD;

// ✅ RIGHT - n8n Credentials
// Use Credentials feature for:
- API keys
- Passwords
- SSH keys
- Tokens
```

**Access Control**:

```
Network Segmentation:
- n8n server in management VLAN
- Firewall rules limiting outbound access
- VPN required for remote n8n access

Authentication:
- Enable n8n basic auth or LDAP
- Strong passwords (20+ characters)
- 2FA if available

API Security:
- Use API tokens instead of passwords
- Rotate credentials quarterly
- Audit credential access
- Revoke unused credentials
```

**Audit Logging**:

```javascript
// Log every agent action
const logEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  agent: "vishnu-cto",
  action: "container_restart",
  target: "plex",
  authorized_by: "human_approval",
  approval_id: "APR-20240115-001",
  result: "success",
  user_id: $json.telegram_user_id
};

// Store logs:
// - Local file (/var/log/n8n-agent-actions.log)
// - Database (for queryability)
// - SIEM system (for enterprise environments)
```

**Security Monitoring**:

```
Monitor the Monitors:
- Who accessed n8n?
- What workflows were modified?
- What credentials were used?
- What agents took actions?
- Were approvals properly obtained?

Alert on:
- Failed authentication attempts >5
- Workflow changes outside business hours
- Credentials accessed by unusual users
- Agent actions without approval
- New workflows created
```

---

### Section 10.3: Performance Optimization

**Polling Frequency**:

```
Service Type         | Recommended Interval
---------------------|---------------------
Critical (Database)  | Every 2-5 minutes
Important (Web Apps) | Every 5-10 minutes
Standard (Media)     | Every 10-15 minutes
Non-Critical (Dev)   | Every 30-60 minutes

Avoid over-polling:
- Wastes API quota
- Increases costs (LLM API calls)
- Creates alert fatigue
- Adds server load
```

**Caching Strategy**:

```javascript
// Cache service status to reduce redundant checks
const cache = $('WorkflowStaticData').first().json.cache || {};
const cacheKey = `status_${serviceName}`;
const cachedStatus = cache[cacheKey];
const now = Date.now();

// Use cache if fresh (< 5 minutes old)
if (cachedStatus && (now - cachedStatus.timestamp) < 5 * 60 * 1000) {
  return { json: cachedStatus.data };
}

// Otherwise, fetch fresh data
const freshStatus = await checkService();

// Update cache
cache[cacheKey] = {
  timestamp: now,
  data: freshStatus
};

return { json: freshStatus };
```

**Conditional Execution**:

```javascript
// Only trigger notifications on state change
const previousState = $('WorkflowStaticData').first().json.last_status || {};
const currentState = $json.status;

if (previousState.status === currentState.status) {
  // No change, skip notification
  return [];
}

// State changed, send notification
$('WorkflowStaticData').first().json.last_status = currentState;
return { json: { notify: true, state_change: true } };
```

**Resource Limits**:

```yaml
# If running n8n in Docker
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2'
          memory: 2G
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
```

**Workflow Optimization**:

```
Slow Workflow Pattern:
[Trigger] → [Agent] → [Wait 30s] → [Agent] → [Wait 30s] → [Agent]
Total time: 90+ seconds

Optimized Pattern:
[Trigger] → [Agent with all tools] → [Parallel checks] → [Synthesize]
Total time: 10-20 seconds

Use parallel execution where possible:
- Multiple service checks
- Multiple API calls
- Multiple SSH commands
```

---

### Section 10.4: Reliability Guidelines

**Fallback Mechanisms**:

```javascript
// Multi-channel notifications with fallback
async function sendNotification(message) {
  try {
    // Primary: Telegram
    await sendTelegram(message);
  } catch (error) {
    try {
      // Fallback: Email
      await sendEmail(message);
    } catch (error2) {
      try {
        // Last resort: Write to file
        fs.appendFileSync('/var/log/failed-notifications.log', 
          JSON.stringify({ timestamp: Date.now(), message, error: error2 }));
      } catch (error3) {
        // Critical: Can't notify at all
        console.error("CRITICAL: All notification methods failed");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Health Checks for Monitoring System**:

```
Monitor the Monitor:
Create a separate workflow that checks if your main monitoring workflows are running.

[Schedule: Every hour]
  ↓
[Check: When was last execution of main workflow?]
  ↓
[IF: >15 minutes ago]
  YES ↓
      [ALERT: Monitoring system appears down!]
      [Send via external service - email, SMS, PagerDuty]
```

**Graceful Degradation**:

```javascript
// If one tool fails, try alternatives
async function checkService(url) {
  try {
    // Primary: HTTP Request tool
    return await httpCheck(url);
  } catch (error) {
    try {
      // Fallback: Curl via Execute Command
      return await curlCheck(url);
    } catch (error2) {
      // Can't check, assume down
      return {
        status: "unknown",
        error: "All check methods failed",
        last_known_status: getFromCache(url)
      };
    }
  }
}
```

**Recovery Procedures**:

Document manual recovery steps:

```markdown
## Emergency Recovery: n8n Agent System Down

1. Check n8n is running:
   ```
   docker ps | grep n8n
   systemctl status n8n
   ```

2. Check n8n logs:
   ```
   docker logs n8n --tail 100
   journalctl -u n8n -n 100
   ```

3. Restart n8n:
   ```
   docker restart n8n
   systemctl restart n8n
   ```

4. Verify workflows activate:
   - Login to n8n web interface
   - Check each workflow's Active status
   - Manually execute one workflow to test

5. If persistent issues:
   - Disable all workflows
   - Re-enable one at a time
   - Identify problematic workflow

6. Nuclear option:
   - Restore n8n from backup
   - Reimport workflow exports
```

**Backup Strategy**:

```bash
# Daily backup of n8n data
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/n8n"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup n8n database
docker exec n8n sqlite3 /home/node/.n8n/database.sqlite ".backup /tmp/backup.db"
docker cp n8n:/tmp/backup.db ${BACKUP_DIR}/database-${DATE}.sqlite

# Backup workflows (export as JSON)
# Via n8n API or manual export

# Keep last 30 days
find ${BACKUP_DIR} -name "*.sqlite" -mtime +30 -delete

# Upload to cloud storage
rclone copy ${BACKUP_DIR} remote:n8n-backups
```

### Section 10.5: Team Collaboration Best Practices

**Clear Role Assignment**:

```
Document each agent's domain:

agents/
├── vishnu-cto.md
│   - Responsibilities: Overall orchestration
│   - Escalation triggers: Multi-system failures
│   - Decision authority: Final say on all issues
│
├── brahma-network.md  
│   - Responsibilities: UniFi, routing, Wi-Fi
│   - Escalation: Issues beyond network scope
│   - Tools: UniFi API, network diagnostics
│
├── saraswati-database.md
│   - Responsibilities: PostgreSQL, MySQL
│   - Escalation: Data integrity threats
│   - Forbidden: Write operations without approval
│
└── ...
```

**Escalation Paths**:

```
Level 1: Hanuman (Helpdesk)
  ├─ Can resolve: Common questions, status checks
  ├─ Escalate to: Specialists for technical issues
  └─ Timeline: Respond within 5 minutes

Level 2: Specialists (Brahma, Saraswati, Ganesha, Shiva)
  ├─ Can resolve: Domain-specific technical issues
  ├─ Escalate to: Vishnu for multi-system coordination
  └─ Timeline: Respond within 15 minutes

Level 3: Vishnu (CTO)
  ├─ Can resolve: Complex multi-system issues
  ├─ Escalate to: Human for business decisions
  └─ Timeline: Respond within 30 minutes

Level 4: Human
  ├─ Can resolve: Anything (final authority)
  └─ Timeline: Best effort (SLA depends on severity)
```

**Knowledge Sharing**:

```javascript
// Shared knowledge base accessible to all agents
const kb = {
  "plex_common_issues": [
    {
      "symptom": "Remote access not working",
      "solution": "Check port 32400 forwarding, Plex server settings",
      "solved_count": 12,
      "success_rate": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "network_topology": {
    "vlans": {
      "10": "Management",
      "20": "User Devices",
      "30": "Servers",
      "40": "IoT"
    },
    "aps": [
      { "name": "Living Room AP", "ip": "192.168.1.10" }
    ]
  },
  "service_dependencies": {
    "plex": ["nas", "network"],
    "website": ["docker", "network"],
    "database": ["storage", "network"]
  }
};

// Agents reference KB before troubleshooting
// Update KB after resolving new issues
```

**Version Control**:

```bash
# Export workflows regularly
# Store in git repo

workflows/
├── monitoring-main.json
├── approval-handler.json
├── brahma-network.json
├── saraswati-database.json
└── README.md

# Commit after significant changes
git add workflows/
git commit -m "Add database slow query detection to Saraswati"
git push

# Tags for stable versions
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Production-ready release"
```

**Change Management**:

```
Before modifying production workflows:
1. Document change in issue tracker
2. Test in development environment
3. Peer review (or self-review with checklist)
4. Deploy during maintenance window
5. Monitor for 24 hours after change
6. Document results and lessons learned

For emergency fixes:
1. Fix the immediate issue
2. Document what was changed
3. Proper testing and documentation follow-up within 48 hours
```

### Section 11.3: Example Workflows

Below are workflow templates you can import into your n8n instance. Each includes configuration notes and customization instructions.

#### Example 1: Basic Service Monitor

**Purpose**: Monitor a single HTTP service every 5 minutes

**Workflow JSON** (Basic structure - customize for your service):
```json
{
  "name": "Basic Service Monitor",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "rule": {
          "interval": [
            {
              "field": "cronExpression",
              "expression": "*/5 * * * *"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "name": "Schedule Trigger",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger"
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "systemPrompt": "You are a service monitoring agent. Check if the service is online using the HTTP tool. Report status clearly."
      },
      "name": "AI Agent",
      "type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent"
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "url": "={{ $json.service_url }}",
        "method": "GET"
      },
      "name": "HTTP Request",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Customization**:
- Change `cronExpression` for different intervals
- Update `systemPrompt` for service-specific instructions
- Add Telegram notification node for alerts

---

#### Example 2: Multi-Service Dashboard

**Purpose**: Check multiple services and generate status report

**Configuration**:
```javascript
// Code node: Define services to check
const services = [
  { name: "Plex", url: "http://192.168.1.100:32400" },
  { name: "Proxmox", url: "https://proxmox:8006" },
  { name: "NAS", url: "http://nas:5000" },
  { name: "UniFi", url: "https://unifi:8443" }
];

return services.map(service => ({ json: service }));
```

Then loop through each with AI Agent + HTTP Request, aggregate results, and send comprehensive report via Telegram.

---

#### Example 3: Approval Flow Template

**Purpose**: Request human approval before executing commands

**Key Components**:
1. Detect issue
2. Generate fix proposal
3. Send to Telegram with YES/NO buttons
4. Wait for response (separate workflow with Telegram Trigger)

## Closing Note

As you embark on this journey of building an AI-powered IT department for your homelab, remember the ancient wisdom that guides these agents:

**Sanskrit Shlok** (Blessing for Your Infrastructure):

> **"सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु सर्वे सन्तु निरामया ।  
> सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु मा कश्चिद्दुःखभाग्भवेत् ॥"**
>
> *"Sarve bhadrāṇi paśyantu sarve santu nirāmayā |  
> Sarve bhadrāṇi paśyantu mā kaścid duḥkhabhāg bhavet ||"*

**Translation**:
> "May all beings see auspiciousness, may all beings be free from illness.  
> May all beings experience prosperity, may no one experience suffering."

**Applied to Your Homelab**:
> "May all your services see uptime, may all your systems be free from failures.  
> May all your infrastructure experience stability, may no user experience downtime."

---

### Final Wisdom from the Agents

**Vishnu (CTO)** says:
> "Balance is the key. Monitor closely, but trust your systems. Automate wisely, but remain in control. Your infrastructure is an ecosystem—nurture it."

**Brahma (Infrastructure)** says:
> "Build with intention. Every service has a purpose. Every network segment has a reason. Create with vision, not just reaction."

**Saraswati (Knowledge)** says:
> "Document everything. The knowledge you capture today saves hours tomorrow. Your future self will thank your present self."

**Ganesha (Security)** says:
> "Remove obstacles, but create necessary barriers. Security is not paranoia—it's wisdom. Protect what matters."

**Shiva (DevOps)** says:
> "Embrace change. The old must make way for the new. Break without fear, for you have backups. Deploy with confidence."

**Hanuman (Service)** says:
> "Serve with devotion. Every user issue matters. Every ticket deserves attention. Your dedication defines the experience."
